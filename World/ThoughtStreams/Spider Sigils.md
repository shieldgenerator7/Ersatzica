# Spider Sigils

(2023-07-10: Listening to a song on repeat while writing this: <https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=1GZzRgSNJLQ&feature=share> )

I thought this up a week or two ago, but just got the inspiration now while watching the underdark scene during my 2nd watch through of D&D: Honor Among Thieves.

So the spiders in the world of Ersatzica originated with the character Alotus, who I want a short story about. She had to defend the Arachnid Archives from Jactus, a powerful mage.

I wanted to incorporate Alotus into this same world, so the spider faction became a thing. Since its inception, it has always had something to do with draining magic from other sources and using that to power their own spells.

Alotus was inspired by Miss Muffet from Undertale. (And more recently by that one owl daughter from Helluva Boss, potentially)

So the spider’s racial ability is drain. Originally it was just life drain, as it literally drained the blood out of anyone who touched it. But then like the other races, the spiders learned how to manipulate their racial ability to do other things. They can manipulate it to drain other things besides life. Such as will power, heat, light, and other things.

Spiders can even weave spells into their webs and stick them on objects to affect them.

This might seem like its an extra thing on top of the other magic systems, but it’s actually an extension of the Warehouse 13 mechanic. When a spider dies, they may power up a personal sigil they created and stored in the arachnid archives. That sigil then becomes a spell. Whenever another spider recreates that sigil with their web, it becomes a copy of that spell and has its same effect.

Usually heirlooms can be ship-of-thesius’d, and thus more “copies” of it can be created. But this is something else, it’s turning matter that was never part of the original into a copy of the spell.

Example spells include a heat absorption spell. One spider died and their sigil became one that can absorb heat. Recreating the sigil with a web and placing the handheld web on an object causes it to absorb heat, including fire and fireballs and stuff.

Note that the direction matters. Because spiders’ original drain is meant so they can absorb whatever the web drained and redirect it somewhere, all the sigil spells have an absorb side and exit side. If you put the sigil on a piece of armor, for example, and you put it on “correctly”, the armor now absorbs all fire damage and protects you from it. If you put the sigil on the “wrong” way, the armor will absorb heat from you and it will slowly make you colder. Depending on where you are and what the situation is, either way could be very useful.

Another is a light absorption spell. Placing this sigil on something causes it to absorb light. This turns the wearer into a silhouette that is harder to detect, especially while in the shadows. (tho for the purposes of stealth, this effect is less effective than a combination of Retriyoan’s Boots and Yotleph’s Skull, but this sigil is way easier to apply to an entire army than either of those two heirlooms). And then you can later use the light absorbed by it to use it as a flashlight.

Not all spiders die and create a sigil, even if they did have a personal sigil on file in the Arachnid Archives. But even with only a small percentage of spiders actually creating a sigil, after all these years, there’s hundreds of sigil spells. Many of which are hidden away so know one ever finds them, many of which have still yet to be figured out, and many of which have been dumped and dismissed as inactive. Some are even seemingly duplicates of each other. The chances of two different heirlooms from two different individuals having the exact same effect are exceedingly rare, but it’s possible. And it happens more frequently in the spider faction, especially because they value blending in.

One secret that not many know, not even the spiders, is that yes, the spider webs can recreate any spell sigil in the Arachnid Archives, but that’s not all. If the sigil is created in other mediums, like a carving, an engraving, or embroidery, it also becomes a copy of that spell. This doesn’t come up very often, because to recreate the sigil, you have to also copy the basic web pattern. And the spiders guard their sigil library very closely. Outsiders and other factions don’t get access to it enough to recreate it. And when they do sometimes find dead spiders with sigils on them, the sigils have usually been messed up so they don’t work anymore.

Sometime in the future, Ersatzica meets a member of each faction and finds a way to combine their best qualities to combat the big bad at that time. And she creates suits of armor that have spider sigils on them for protection.

Fun fact: One time a cat did manage to find an intact sigil and write it in a book, but the sigil activated on the page, absorbed heat from the sunlit window and greenhouse’d room, and then it caught the book on fire. It destroyed the book and a few other books before the fire was put out. Lots of information was lost in that incident. Its possible that either they didn’t know it was the spider sigil that caused it, or that they thought all spider sigils were dangerous and thus were banned from writing them down.

So spiders have multiple limbs. In this world, they follow the popular anthro-ization of spiders: 2 legs, 6 arms, bipedal movement. But I also like the idea of the spiders using quadrupedal movement, of sorts. I imagine keeping balance on walls and ceilings would be hard with only two legs, so I’m making all limbs basically the same structure, where they can be used as a foot or hand. The 4th set of limbs are used mostly as feet, and the 3rd set of limbs is used as legs when climbing, and feet when on flat ground for holding more things.

So these sigils can be hard to reproduce, so many spiders craft them once and use the same sigil for as long as their web material holds up (and if they’re eating right, their web material holds up for a looong time). Sigils mess each other up when combined on top of each other, so they have to be separated. Most spiders craft the most popular protection sigils and store them in their palms. With 8 palms, they can store 8 sigils in total. More if they also choose to store some on their body.

Oh! Tattoos! Spiders probably use tattoos more than any other faction. They create the web sigil and stick it on their body to make sure it works, then they burn the sigil onto their exoskeleton. Wait… can spiders even get tattoos? Would tattoos even work on an exoskeleton? Maybe some have skin? But wouldn’t having skin make molting especially difficult?

Also, spiders \*do\* wear clothes. I don’t know why exactly. But I imagine spiders wearing clothes a lot. Maybe it’s easier to weave sigils into clothes than to do tattoos. It’s probably also the anonymity thing, and clothes help spiders blend in with each other. Oh! Spiders can produce their own silk to make their own clothes, which makes it easier to put sigils in their clothes. Also, the natural drain ability of their webs help protect them against other threats. This probably means all their clothes will be white, and will be pretty much full body coverings.

The spiders live in the mountain ranges. There’s lots of walls to climb there, which helps keep them safe. And they have ways of finding caves and making caves, which also give them places to hide.

This is due to some history. The alien pod that fell to the planet and created the initial anthro species fell on the mountain. The spiders decided to keep it safe. They built the Arachnid Archive on top of it. It’s hidden at the very bottom, behind several layers of “security”, which consists mostly of dangerous webbing that is super hard to get past.

Oh! And because they live in the mountains, there’s lots of snow during most times of the year, which makes it easier for their white silk robes to blend in with the white snow! And because of the cold, most spiders weave the heat sigil into their robes, which absorbs heat. They then use that to warm themselves and keep themselves safe from the cold.

The Arachnid Archive is a vast underground structure with several entrances, each guarded by an unknown amount of guards. If you go there, and ask for a guardian, no one will admit to being a guard. They never confront you directly, but they’ll set traps for you with the intention of dissuading you from continuing. And if you go far enough, they’ll trap you with intent to kill, and perhaps even eat.

Spiders are cannibals. They never hunt each other, but they often eat those among them that die. Because of that, spiders very seldomly have body parts that can carry on and become an heirloom.

Spiders rarely leave the Arachnid Archive. A few hatchlings manage to escape every year before any spider can stop them from throwing their web in the air to be carried off in the wind. These hatchlings are usually not old enough to even know what’s going on, and are just following their spider instinct. These spiders are usually not welcomed in the other factions and often don’t survive. These spiders are very seldomly domesticated and very hungry, which makes them an active threat to other creatures. If the spider is lucky enough to survive, it’s usually by itself.

Miraculously, there was once a cluster of spider hatchlings that got caught in the same current, ended up in the same spot, and started their own village. They know nothing of the teachings of the original spider (whose name had been intentionally forgotten by the spider faction to protect her identity). They grew to have their own language (because English is usually passed down from the parents, but not in this case (yes, English, our English, bc lore reasons). They don’t know any history or any Arachnid Archive stuff, except that they’ve heard rumors of. They are very proficient with their web of blood draining for hunting. They don’t know anything about safety, either. They’re more like barbarians. They’re big and strong for spiders, and they’ve evolved different from the spiders in the mountains. Over the generations, more and more of these spiders have learned English, but most of them still don’t. Their spider language is unknown to most other factions, because they use their spider features more, making sounds that other species just can’t. This spider faction lives in an area most other factions would consider inhospitable. Probably a desert area or something.

Spiders don’t usually travel, and they don’t get many visitors. Every so often, a traveler comes to deposit an artifact into the Arachnid Archives, and it gets rapidly stored somewhere. Taking something out, however, is super difficult, even for the one who originally put it in.

Jactus from the original story was trying to take something out, tho im not sure what. During the import, Jactus became a beaver, with powerful telekinesis ability, even for a beaver. He’s really good at controlling tiny specks of dust, which most other beavers can’t do because of all the concentration it takes to control each piece. But Jactus has figured out how to do it easily, which he can use as a weapon. It turns out having lots of tiny specks flying at the speed of sound does a lot of damage. His telekinesis also allows him to rip open webs and disrupt sigils quite easily.

Jactus tore through several waves of spiders and traps before coming across Alotus, who was the last guardian in charge of protecting the alien pod at the bottom of the Arachnid Archives. Well, before you get to the maze of spider webs that had been built up over several hundred years. Even with the ability to rip open webs, it’s not an easy time to get through it unharmed.

Alotus initially did like in the story, avoiding Jactus, absorbing his attacks (using sigils not many spiders know about), and tricking him with traps. But then she had to make a decision: keep herself safe and risk the safety of others by letting Jactus in, or risk her own safety to keep others safe. And in the end, she chose to protect others, over her own self. She managed to get a drain spell of some kind onto Jactus’ tail and stopped him from using telekinesis.

You may wonder: why didn’t they just do that from the start? The spiders don’t see outsiders much, and when they do, it’s usually a deer or peacock. They don’t see beavers very often, much less one with such powerful telekinesis. They didn’t know they had to suppress its tail to make it stop.

Because spiders are the only faction with the alien pod that created the original anthros, they’re the only ones who can give it creatures to anthro-ize. They unleash lots of other spider species into the pit where the alien pod is, and very often they get anthro-ized, and need rescued. There’s a way out, that is next to impossible to use as a way in. They have a group waiting at the exit for newly anthro-ized spiders. They welcome new citizens to the collective.

The non-anthro-ized spiders also serve a purpose: ward of intruders. These spiders are very often kept in the depths near the alien pod and aren’t allowed in other places of the colony. Many are poisonous and venomous, which makes going down there even more dangerous. And with all those feral spiders down there, insects have a really hard time reaching the alien pod to get anthro-ized. Furthermore, if one did, it would be killed immediately when it exited the depths.

One time the alien pod planned a coup by allowing an ant colony to grow inside its chamber. When the ants became numerous and strong enough, the alien pod anthro-ized them all at once, and an entire ant army descended upon the greeting party, and killed them all.

I want there to be an ant faction so bad, but I don’t think the ants were original. The ant faction moved away and went into hiding. Not many know where they are, and many believe them to have died out. But secretly, they await underground, planning to eventually break the alien pod out of the Arachnid Archives and help it complete its mission. I wasn’t really planning on doing this faction for real, so I don’t really know much about it. And most of the residents of the world don’t even know the ant faction even exists. Unlike the spider faction, which everyone knows of but doesn’t know a whole lot about.

## Arachnid Archives vs the Peacock Holds

The peacocks also have storage units to keep records, history, and protect dangerous artifacts from falling into the wrong hands. Most factions have something like this, to some extent. The peacock holds is the second most known one, and is respected as the hardest to break into after the Arachnid Archives. But as Pantrinome and her husband showed, it’s actually quite easy to break into the holds. The holds themselves are outhouse-shaped buildings with strong, sturdy walls and a single door. Two guards guard the door at all times. There’s several of these strewn around the peacock villages and towns. None are next to each other. These holds are honored as sacred places to store mementos from past loved ones. Some even use them to store precious items for when coming out of petristasis (cryostasis but from being petrified). They are often decorated inside and outside with portraits of famous peacock warrioris, politicians, and artists.

Even with employing wolves, the fiercest warrior species in the lands that will quite often work for hire, the peacock holds are relatively easy to break into. Sure, it’s not as easy as breaking into the impromptu relic storage units of other factions, but they pale to the Arachnid Archives.

The Arachnid Archives is a maze-like mess of corridors, natural and crafted. Even without the spiders, the chances of dying down there without a guide are huge, because it’s so easy to get lost. But with the spider traps, and spider guards, getting in is a death sentence. Much less getting out alive.

## Misc

Crap, now I want to write a story about the Arachnid Archives.

# Notable Characters

## Amalgamation (Cat?)

I don’t know this character’s name yet, but they’re an amalgation of lots of different species. Basically Discord but as a spider. It has a spider spinneret, at least one deer hoof with a middle finger, two or three “bald spot” bumps, a sideways sabertooth, a limb replaced with a red-tipped tail, a hand replaced with a flat round tail, a “skirt” that goes over their abdomen and has a grey spot on it, and limbs from the other anthro species.

It basically has the racial ability of all the species (except ant).

Hmmm… maybe not. The original idea was a being that had quadruped limbs and biped limbs, and used one set or the other. Like it had 4 cat limbs that it used to run on all fours, and it had two wolf arms and two bear legs for walking on two legs. When it walked on two legs, its 4 cat limbs curled up against its body to get out of the way. And when it walked on four legs, its wolf arms and bear legs folded up against its belly to get out of the way of its cat legs.

Maybe it’s a spider-cat hybrid or spider-deer hybrid. It’s probably one that was kicked out of the colony due to being so weird and dangerous-looking.

Yeah, its probably that the weird scary spiders were the ones kicked out. Not necessarily the ones that were different, new species, but the spiders who stood out and didn’t blend in, and did so for the wrong reasons.

This guy probably lives among the cats in the cat kingdom, and is accepted as a cat, because it is half cat. And maybe even has cat fire claws (im thinking of changing the fire tail to a fire claw)

I just realized 4 species have racial abilities tied to their tail: cat, spider, beaver, peacock. That’s too many. I wanted each species ability to be on a different body part.

Cat – Red mark on chest – “Heart Fire” – Create flames

Wolf – Bald Spot – “Hindsight” – Seeing into the past

Deer – Third hoof finger – “Illusion Magic” – Polymorph

Bear – Tooth-shaped growth on nose – “Saber Sense” – Pain Sensing

Peacock – Grey Spot on Tail – “Petra’s Eye” – Petrification

Beaver – Split buck teeth – “?” – Telekinesis

Spider – two fang-shaped holes in the abdomen – “?” – Drain Spells (default: blood drain)

Ant? – Striped Antennae – “Queen’s Mind” – Telepathy

Maybe this character’s name will be “Cat”, because he’s half cat and half spider, and wants to be a cat.

## Alotus

Defended the Arachnid Archives from Jactus. Eventually she and Jactus join Ersatzica’s group.

Given the name Alotus by a traveler, or someone. She didn’t have a name before leaving the Archnid Archives.

## Spider Goddess

Her name has been intentionally forgotten to protect her identity. She was the original anthro spider and prioritized safety over all else. She led the initiative to guard the alien pod from interacting with any creature ever again.
