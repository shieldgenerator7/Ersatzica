# Boots of Retriyoan

Cat

These boots were made by Retriyoan to prevent fall damage. When she died, she empowered the boots to also negate all outgoing sound, rendering the wearers indetectable by ears.

Worn by Pantrinome when she raided the wolf village for revenge, and fixed up and modified by Ersatzica.

## Rules

### Requirements

In order to activate its effect, these requirements must be met:

1.  The wearer must be able to fit a limb inside the boots and latch it such that the limb can not simply slide out
2.  At least one boot must be worn
3.  At least one latch must be latched, and that latched latch must be on a boot that is being worn

The following are not requirements:

1.  Both boots be worn
2.  Both latches be latched
3.  Both boots be in proximity to each other
4.  The limb in the boot is a foot
5.  The wearer is a cat (or species the boot is made to fit)
6.  The boot was put on by the wearer (someone else may force the boot on)
7.  The boot was latched by the wearer (someone else may latch it)
8.  The wearer is alive
9.  The wearer is animate (inanimate objects can wear the boots)

#### Ship of Thesius

The boots can be taken apart (and they do get taken apart by Ersatzica). Each piece contains a part of Retriyoan’s essence. If each piece could individually satisfy the requirements, they could each on their own provide the same effect that the whole boot does. However, because most pieces can’t be worn and/or latched on their own, they do not satisfy the requirements in order to activate the effect. The gears can’t be worn (no, wearing it like a button doesn’t count), nor can they be latched. The mouth of the boot can be worn, but it can’t be latched by itself (tho you could install a separate set of latches on it to satisfy this requirement). The latches can be latched, but can’t be worn (tho you could install them on a separate set of boots to satisfy this requirement).

So yes, you could ship of thesius the Boots of Retriyoan. However, I dislike the idea of doing so.

### Effects

The boots negate sound coming from the wearer. The point of origin for this effect comes from the wearer, not the boots. The wearer has an aura around them that negates sound. Things they wear, and things in their pockets, and things they’re holding don’t make sound. If they’re holding a bag of coins, or have the coins in their pocket, the coins won’t make sound, even though they aren’t directly touching the coins.

The boots only block outgoing sound, not incoming sound. This means that the wearer can still hear noises around them.

In addition to sound negation, the boots negate fall damage, which is what they were originally designed to do.

## Description

*It was shaped like a thick hind leg of a cat, but at the bottom, it had a steel plate that attached to the underside of the boot via springs and a piston. The underside of the plate held remnants of some kind of material that had since decayed. Straight gears and round gears worked in unison to let the boot slide forward and backward on the plate. A pulley system with a missing string could have potentially wound from a winch in the front, up the sides, and into a pull string at the lip of the boot. Two latches sealed the boot together, and widened the mouth of the boot when sprung open. The golden trim stretched from the circular lip of the boot, down the underside, and pulled up over the top for the toe protector.*

*Ersie noticed a tension bolt on the heel. She focused in on it. It had gears on its head, that moved two gold-plated straight gears open or closed around the heel. She played with it, and noted that they indeed changed the size of the boot, to a limited degree.*

# Wolf Skin of Monassus

Wolf

A wolf skin that turns a non-wolf into a wolf.

*And in the dim glow of the lantern light, in the center of the floor, lied a fur pelt of a black and white wolf.*

When a non-wolf puts it on, it merges with their body and turns them into a wolf. Specifically, it makes them look like Monassus. It changes what is there to look like Monassus. It does not add or remove anything. If the wearer is missing half their tail as a non-wolf, they’ll still be missing half their tail as a wolf wearing this skin. If the wearer has non-wolf features such as antlers as a non-wolf, they’ll still have antlers as a wolf wearing this skin.

There is no apparent way to take the wolf skin off. However, the wolf skin will detach itself and turn the wearer back to normal when the wearer desires to be a non-wolf animal, or desires to no longer be a wolf.

If the wearer wears the wolf skin for a long period of time, they will still age as though they didn’t wear the wolf skin.

It can be Ship of Theseus’d, but the new pieces don’t gain any magic properties.

# Pantrinome’s Drum

Cat

A wearable drum that controls the action rate of those who sync to it.

# Feistiven’s Tooth

Wolf

A tooth amulet that kills anyone who tries to kill the wearer, Final Destination style, with preference for stabbing through the heart.

# Yotleph’s Skull

Wolf

A wolf skull that renders evidence of humanoid presence invisible to those outside its perimeter. It only works on sight, but does not conceal scent or sounds.

It can be ship of theseus’d, but the smaller pieces produce a smaller radius.

# Quivester’s Feather

Cat

An orange feather that grants powers to all hats it gets pierced through. The wearer of these hats becomes a cat if they are not already a cat.

The effect activates when they put the hat on. The effect does not automatically end when they take the hat off. The effect ends when they are not wearing the hat and desire to return to their original form.

# Cuffs of ?

Cat?

Metal cuff links that grant the wearer zero-point telekinesis, up to a weight limit. Scales with the wearer’s natural strength.

# Scope of ?

Cat?

Telescope that lets you see through solid objects.

# Stopwatch of ?

Cat?

Stopwatch that has a timer that can be set. When it goes off, every object in its vicinity gets rewound to the time when the stop watch timer was started.

# Garoftle’s Candle

Bear

A candle that never goes out, as long as it has fuel. It can spread. It can burn hands. When a person has their hand burnt, they are gifted with the power to seal open wounds with their burnt hand.

# Antlers of Truth

Deer

A pair of antlers that show a person’s or an object’s true nature when one views it through this pair of antlers. Often used with a reflective surface, especially a pool of water, so the user can see themselves.

# Sash of Soofawkoo

Peacock

Grants the wearer indestructible fists while punching.

# Well of Growth

Deer

While the sun shines directly into the well, the water inside becomes enchanted. Drawing the water from the well allows it to retain its magical properties. When the sunlight leaves the well, all water stops being enchanted by the well.

Enchanted water from the Well of Growth increases the growing speed of plants watered with it by 200%.

# Nosalen’s Paw

Wolf

Any water or water-based solution that comes within range of this paw and has line of sight to it freezes rapidly into ice. The paw heats up as it freezes the water.

Nosalen was a light-framed wolf who was also really fast. He could skate along thin ice that most would fall through. He also was very good at skipping rocks, and figured out how to apply that physics to his feet, allowing him to take a certain amount of steps across water. He drowned in the river in winter time. When he was found, his foot was sticking out of the ice on the surface.

# The Moon

Wolf

The wolves believe that howling at the moon right before dying allows their soul to go to heaven on the Moon. However, the Moon is way too far to be a valid target for their soul power.

# Blood of Artyr

Wolf

Artyr was a merciless warrior. He would maim his foes and then drink their blood while they were still alive and conscious, but immobilized.

He died in a last stand against a battalion of cats. His adrenaline-filled blood became an heirloom when he was felled.

Drinking a drop of blood grants thickened skin, increased muscle capacity, and an insatiable desire to kill. Perhaps also an increased healing factor? The effect wears off when the user pees out all the blood.

Ship of Theseus: As long as the user has at least one Artyr blood cell in their body, they gain the full effects. Drinking more Artyr blood only increases the likely duration of the effect.

The blood cells are immune to being digested.

Plants and animals can consume the blood cells too, gaining the same effects, but they manifest different in plants. (is it possible the Well of Growth is related to this heirloom?)

# Sticker of Teleportation

Spider

It is unknown who left this heirloom.

It is a badge made out of spider web, hardened into an amorphous, flat shape.

When it comes in contact with a magic signature, it absorbs some of the magic to teleport the wearer to a random location within 1 mile. The location is someplace the wearer can stand, and has room for the wearer. The sticker picks a safe location for the wearer to go as much as it can, and picks one at random if there’s several options, prioritizing the safer options.

# Web Band of Docility

Spider

It is unknown who left this heirloom.

When thrown, it latches onto the first target hit. It leeches adrenaline out of its target and drains them of angry emotions.

# Sticker of Peacock

Spider

It is unknown who left this heirloom.

When the user experiences fear, their skin turns to stone. They slowly turn to stone more and more layer by layer. They can still sense if danger is near while in stone form. Once they no longer feel afraid, they turn back to normal.

# Sash of Sawyookaw

Peacock

Memories that the user makes while wearing this sash are remembered in complete detail.

Sawyookaw was a peacock painter that was known for being able to look at a scene once and be able to paint it in great detail later.

# Silhouette’s Chandelier

Cat

Silhouette was a cat who liked to host dinner parties. She had this chandelier custom ordered. When she died, the chandelier became an heirloom.

A candle placed in this chandelier casts enchanted light. This enchanted light plays with shadows. Heirlooms in the light cast shadows of their former bodies, and these bodies behave and more like the heirloom occupant. These shadows can also see into the room perpendicular to where the shadow’s eyes are. The shadows also have missing holes in them where the heirloom occupant eyes would be.

The exception to this rule is Silhouette’s shadow. Her shadow can move around anywhere it wants within the area illuminated by the candles.

The shadows cannot interact with physical objects, but they avoid each other and other shadows when possible.

# Bridge of Picket and Roastboard

Cat

Picket and Roastboard were two cat brothers who grew apart when they couldn’t decide how to divvy up the land their father left. They finally made amends by building a bridge over the creek they dug and the fences they put up.

When two fence posts are planted in the ground so it can stand upright, and it’s facing a fence post from the opposite brother, a bridge magically gets built over the fence posts. This effect has a range of 1 mile. The bridge building starts on both sides of the fence posts, and continues until they meet somewhere in between, usually in the middle. The bridge is about wide enough for 2 people to walk comfortably side to side. If the bridge building process encounters obstacles, it will go around them if the width of the bridge could go around it. If not, the bridge building stops from that side.

As long as the fence posts are planted, the bridge will continue to build itself and rebuild itself if damaged. Rock and dirt from near where the bridge is being built are used in the construction of the bridge. This defies gravity.

When the pickets are removed, the effect on the materials ends. If the resulting bridge is stable, it remains. If the resulting bridge is not stable, it is effected by gravity and other outside forces, and will likely crumble.

It is interesting to note that because the bridge gets built over the picket fence posts, the bridge actually protects the posts and makes them difficult to remove.

# The Antlers of Combination

Deer

I think I wrote about this one before but don’t remember what I called it.

The wearer of this naturally-grown combined antler can merge antlers into their body and move these merged antlers around at will. They can merge antlers into other antlers and move them around at will.

queRenari-Ko is the current wearer of this heirloom. And she wears a lot of antlers all over her body.

# Wolf Skin Cape of ?

Wolf

Allows its wearer to teleport a short distance in any direction.

Worn by Treescorn (Drathalion)

# Zayhard’s Shard

?

*“Don’t touch that!” yelled Granfork. “That’s Zayhard’s shard! It’ll cut anything made of flesh!”*
