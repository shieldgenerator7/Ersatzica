# Boots of Pantrinome

Cat

These boots were made by Pantrinome to prevent fall damage. When she died, she empowered the boots to also negate all outgoing sound, rendering the wearers indetectable by ears.

Worn by Pantrinome when she raided the wolf village to kill Awoomoon, and fixed up and modified by Ersatzica.

## Rules

### Requirements

In order to activate its effect, these requirements must be met:

1.  The wearer must be able to fit a limb inside the boots and latch it such that the limb can not simply slide out
2.  At least one boot must be worn
3.  At least one latch must be latched, and that latched latch must be on a boot that is being worn

The following are not requirements:

1.  Both boots be worn
2.  Both latches on a boot be latched
3.  Both boots be in proximity to each other
4.  The limb in the boot is a foot
5.  The wearer is a cat (or species the boot is made to fit)
6.  The boot was put on by the wearer (someone else may force the boot on)
7.  The boot was latched by the wearer (someone else may latch it)
8.  The wearer is alive
9.  The wearer is animate (inanimate objects can wear the boots)

#### Ship of Thesius

The boots can be taken apart (and they do get taken apart by Ersatzica). Each piece contains a part of Pantrinome’s essence. If each piece could individually satisfy the requirements, they could each on their own provide the same effect that the whole boot does. However, because most pieces can’t be worn and/or latched on their own, they do not satisfy the requirements in order to activate the effect. The gears can’t be worn (no, wearing it like a button doesn’t count), nor can they be latched. The mouth of the boot can be worn, but it can’t be latched by itself (tho you could install a separate set of latches on it to satisfy this requirement). The latches can be latched, but can’t be worn (tho you could install them on a separate set of boots to satisfy this requirement).

So yes, you could ship of thesius the Boots of Retriyoan. However, I dislike the idea of doing so.

### Effects

The boots negate sound coming from the wearer. The point of origin for this effect comes from the wearer, not the boots. The wearer has an aura around them that negates sound. Things they wear, and things in their pockets, and things they’re holding don’t make sound. If they’re holding a bag of coins, or have the coins in their pocket, the coins won’t make sound, even though they aren’t directly touching the coins.

The boots only block outgoing sound, not incoming sound. This means that the wearer can still hear noises around them. In fact, the boots amplify sound coming from outside for the wearer, giving them enhanced hearing.

In addition to sound negation, the boots negate fall damage, which is what they were originally designed to do.

## Description

*It was shaped like a thick hind leg of a cat, but at the bottom, it had a steel plate that attached to the underside of the boot via springs and a piston. The underside of the plate held remnants of some kind of material that had since decayed. Straight gears and round gears worked in unison to let the boot slide forward and backward on the plate. A pulley system with a missing string could have potentially wound from a winch in the front, up the sides, and into a pull string at the lip of the boot. Two latches sealed the boot together, and widened the mouth of the boot when sprung open. The golden trim stretched from the circular lip of the boot, down the underside, and pulled up over the top for the toe protector.*

*Ersie noticed a tension bolt on the heel. She focused in on it. It had gears on its head, that moved two gold-plated straight gears open or closed around the heel. She played with it, and noted that they indeed changed the size of the boot, to a limited degree.*

# Wolf Skin of Monassus

Wolf

A wolf skin that turns a non-wolf into a wolf.

*And in the dim glow of the lantern light, in the center of the floor, lied a fur pelt of a black and white wolf.*

When a non-wolf puts it on, it merges with their body and turns them into a wolf. Specifically, it makes them look like Monassus. It changes what is there to look like Monassus. It does not add or remove anything. If the wearer is missing half their tail as a non-wolf, they’ll still be missing half their tail as a wolf wearing this skin. If the wearer has non-wolf features such as antlers as a non-wolf, they’ll still have antlers as a wolf wearing this skin.

There is no apparent way to take the wolf skin off. However, the wolf skin will detach itself and turn the wearer back to normal when the wearer desires to be a non-wolf animal, or desires to no longer be a wolf.

If the wearer wears the wolf skin for a long period of time, they will still age as though they didn’t wear the wolf skin.

It can be Ship of Theseus’d, but the new pieces don’t gain any magic properties.

# Retriyoan’s Drums

Cat

Wearable drums that controls the action rate of those who sync to it.

Originally designed to be strapped to the user’s thigh, facing left and right, and pounded as the user ran.

# Feistiven’s Tooth

Wolf

A tooth amulet that kills anyone who tries to kill the wearer. Bite marks appear in the perpetrator’s neck that would insta-kill most beings. Simply harming doesn’t trigger it, only taking an action with the intent to kill. Can only target one creature at a time. Has a range as long as a spear is typical thrown. If there are several assailants, it prioritizes the closest one. Distance between assailants doesn’t effect its attack rate.

When Awoomoon’s wolf husband died, he kept his promise to always protect her by leaving a single tooth behind. This is how he shows her his loyalty, even after death. Effectively, this heirloom acts as plot armor in most situations.

# Yotleph’s Skull

Wolf

A wolf skull that renders evidence of humanoid presence invisible to those outside its perimeter. It only works on sight, but does not conceal scent or sounds.

It can be ship of theseus’d, but the smaller pieces produce a smaller radius.

Aura field rules apply, if a tooth is worn by a person, and that tooth has a radius smaller than the person’s height, the whole person is still concealed, along with everything they are wearing and holding.

# Quivester’s Feather Hat

Cat

An orange feather hat that turns its wearer into a cat, using their own fur pattern.

The effect activates when they put the hat on. The effect automatically ends when the hat is taken off. The hat static-clings to its wearer, and is not taken off by gravity or other accidentally means of losing a hat. In order for the hat to be removed, it must be intentionally removed. It can be intentionally removed by its wearer or another person. It can be worn on any part of the body, as long as the mouth of the hat is reasonably contacting the wearer’s body. There is a delay between taking the hat off and ending the effect, meaning that taking it off your head and placing it on your chest, and vice versa, doesn’t end the effect.

It can be theseus’d. Both strands of the feather and of the hat are enough to provide the full effect. However, it only works if woven into a hat. The hat does not have to resemble the original hat.

Quivester had a band of outlaws with him, who all had similar hats. It’s quite possible that all of their hats also have the same effect.

# Cuffs of Tigrin

Cat

Metal cuff links that grant the wearer zero-point telekinesis, up to a weight limit. Scales with the wearer’s natural strength.

# Scope of Sureye

Cat

Telescope that lets you see through solid objects.

# Tinsel’s Time Keeper

Cat

Pocket watch that is stuck at the time that Tinsel died. When you wind the knob to go forward in time, and then wind the gear mechanism, it rewinds over the course of a fixed amount of seconds so that it points to the time it’s stuck on. It rewinds time for things that are in its vicinity when the process starts, even if they leave the area as part of the process. Objects that enter the area during the process aren’t effected. How far back the objects get rewound is determined by how far ahead the minutes and seconds were set.

This heirloom can used to rebuild walls, revive people, and relocate back to a previous position.

This was originally logged as a useless heirloom, because winding the gear mechanism causes it to near instantly unwind and the pocket watch doesn’t tick. It took a long time before someone tried setting the time and then winding the gear mechanism. And even when that happened, there was nothing that obviously changed in the area. The only thing that changed was the food in the user’s body, causing them to vomit after the process completed.

You are conscious and can feel the process happening if you are effected by it. You retain all memories even if your whole body gets rewound.

Many heirlooms have an aura of effect, like Retriyoan’s Boots and the Yotleph’s Skull. This heirloom does not. If you get your hand in the area but not the rest of your body, it will only effect your hand, but will pull you by your hand to rewind time for your hand.

This heirloom can’t be Ship of Theseus’d because it rewinds time for itself whenever it breaks and/or is taken apart.

It was at one point considered a cursed item before its effects were fully known, because a user had a violent vomiting reaction to its effects to the point that they needed medical attention afterwards.

# Garoftle’s Candle

Bear

A candle that never goes out, as long as it has fuel. It can spread. It can burn hands. When a person has their hand burnt, they are gifted with the power to seal open wounds with their burnt hand.

# Antlers of Truth

Deer

A pair of antlers that show a person’s or an object’s true nature when one views it through this pair of antlers. Often used with a reflective surface, especially a pool of water, so the user can see themselves.

# Sash of Soofawkoo

Peacock

Grants the wearer indestructible fists while punching.

# Well of Growth

Deer

While the sun shines directly into the well, the water inside becomes enchanted. Drawing the water from the well allows it to retain its magical properties. When the sunlight leaves the well, all water stops being enchanted by the well.

Enchanted water from the Well of Growth increases the growing speed of plants watered with it by 200%.

# Nosalen’s Paw

Wolf

Any water or water-based solution that comes within range of this paw and has line of sight to it freezes rapidly into ice. The paw heats up as it freezes the water.

Nosalen was a light-framed wolf who was also really fast. He could skate along thin ice that most would fall through. He also was very good at skipping rocks, and figured out how to apply that physics to his feet, allowing him to take a certain amount of steps across water. He drowned in the river in winter time. When he was found, his foot was sticking out of the ice on the surface.

# The Moon

Wolf

The wolves believe that howling at the moon right before dying allows their soul to go to heaven on the Moon. However, the Moon is way too far to be a valid target for their soul power.

# Blood of Artyr

Wolf

Artyr was a merciless warrior. He would maim his foes and then drink their blood while they were still alive and conscious, but immobilized.

He died in a last stand against a battalion of cats. His adrenaline-filled blood became an heirloom when he was felled.

Drinking a drop of blood grants thickened skin, increased muscle capacity, and an insatiable desire to kill. Perhaps also an increased healing factor? The effect wears off when the user pees out all the blood.

Ship of Theseus: As long as the user has at least one Artyr blood cell in their body, they gain the full effects. Drinking more Artyr blood only increases the likely duration of the effect.

The blood cells are immune to being digested.

Plants and animals can consume the blood cells too, gaining the same effects, but they manifest different in plants. (is it possible the Well of Growth is related to this heirloom?)

# Sticker of Teleportation

Spider

It is unknown who left this heirloom.

It is a badge made out of spider web, hardened into an amorphous, flat shape.

When it comes in contact with a magic signature, it absorbs some of the magic to teleport the wearer to a random location within 1 mile. The location is someplace the wearer can stand, and has room for the wearer. The sticker picks a safe location for the wearer to go as much as it can, and picks one at random if there’s several options, prioritizing the safer options.

# Web Band of Docility

Spider

It is unknown who left this heirloom.

When thrown, it latches onto the first target hit. It leeches adrenaline out of its target and drains them of angry emotions.

# Sticker of Peacock

Spider

It is unknown who left this heirloom.

When the user experiences fear, their skin turns to stone. They slowly turn to stone more and more layer by layer. They can still sense if danger is near while in stone form. Once they no longer feel afraid, they turn back to normal.

# Sash of Sawyookaw

Peacock

Memories that the user makes while wearing this sash are remembered in complete detail.

Sawyookaw was a peacock painter that was known for being able to look at a scene once and be able to paint it in great detail later.

# Silhouette’s Chandelier

Cat

Silhouette was a cat who liked to host dinner parties. She had this chandelier custom ordered. When she died, the chandelier became an heirloom.

A candle placed in this chandelier casts enchanted light. This enchanted light plays with shadows. Heirlooms in the light cast shadows of their former bodies, and these bodies behave and more like the heirloom occupant. These shadows can also see into the room perpendicular to where the shadow’s eyes are. The shadows also have missing holes in them where the heirloom occupant eyes would be.

The exception to this rule is Silhouette’s shadow. Her shadow can move around anywhere it wants within the area illuminated by the candles.

The shadows cannot interact with physical objects, but they avoid each other and other shadows when possible.

# Bridge of Picket and Roastboard

Cat

Picket and Roastboard were two cat brothers who grew apart when they couldn’t decide how to divvy up the land their father left. They finally made amends by building a bridge over the creek they dug and the fences they put up.

When two fence posts are planted in the ground so it can stand upright, and it’s facing a fence post from the opposite brother, a bridge magically gets built over the fence posts. This effect has a range of 1 mile. The bridge building starts on both sides of the fence posts, and continues until they meet somewhere in between, usually in the middle. The bridge is about wide enough for 2 people to walk comfortably side to side. If the bridge building process encounters obstacles, it ignores it, largely because the obstacle will be repurposed for building materials.

As long as the fence posts are planted, the bridge will continue to build itself and rebuild itself if damaged. Rock and dirt from near where the bridge is being built are used in the construction of the bridge. This defies gravity.

When the pickets are removed, the effect on the materials ends. If the resulting bridge is stable, it remains. If the resulting bridge is not stable, it is effected by gravity and other outside forces, and will likely crumble.

It is interesting to note that because the bridge gets built over the picket fence posts, the bridge actually protects the posts and makes them difficult to remove.

It uses the closest solid it can find, and cuts rectangular bricks out of it that get levitated into place. The sturdiness of the material is not considered, meaning it’s possible for someone to step through a brick if it was made out of less sturdy materials, such as mud or flesh. It also doesn’t consider the longevity of the material. If it makes a brick out of ice, it can melt.

If any bricks fall or are destroyed, it replaces them individually in the order that they fell. If this happens during the initial building process, the fixes happen after the bridge is completed. There may be a delay between the brick breaking and the rebuilding process.

A brick is only replaced if at least 50% of the brick has been destroyed. If a brick has been displaced but not destroyed, it will attempt to move the brick back into its original location.

Bricks can float on their own in the middle of the air while the rebuilding process is happening.

The ground that supports the fence posts will not be considered for building materials.

# The Antlers of Combination

Deer

I think I wrote about this one before but don’t remember what I called it.

The wearer of this naturally-grown combined antler can merge antlers into their body and move these merged antlers around at will. They can merge antlers into other antlers and move them around at will.

queRenari-Ko is the current wearer of this heirloom. And she wears a lot of antlers all over her body.

# Wolf Skin Cape of ?

Wolf

Allows its wearer to teleport a short distance in any direction.

Worn by Treescorn (Drathalion)

# Zayhard’s Shard

?

*“Don’t touch that!” yelled Granfork. “That’s Zayhard’s shard! It’ll cut anything made of flesh!”*

Source: Ersatzica 2015

# Ordaent’s Lock

Wolf?

*She pulled out a lock that was rusted shut and quickly strapped it to her waist.*

*A blue shimmer crossed the lock. It seemed to bolt shut tighter than it already was. The strap around Ersatzica’s waist tightened like thorny vines.*

*Her eyes widened. Of course! You don’t put Ordaent’s Lock on the victim of the heirloom, you put it on the heirloom itself! That’ll stop its effects!*

\-Ersatzica 2025

A lock heirloom that is stuck shut. It negates the effects of heirlooms that it touches or that is in its field. You can expand its field by strapping it to the item in question.

# Roseblood’s Spear

Cat

When the spear tip hits something and stops, it teleports its user to its location, or to some space available for them. This happens whether the spear was thrown or merely thrusted.

Awoomoon’s wolf husband used this heirloom to kill Pantrinome.

The teleport actually blinks the user out of existence for 1 second and then blinks them back into existence at the closest possible point near the spear without phasing into solid objects. Any gas or liquid displaced by the user appears at their original location instead, meaning this heirloom can technically be used to transport water.

When the user is blinked out of existence, they see a black void for that one second, and the spear in the position it landed. They can use this time to slightly adjust where they appear back, and can grab onto the spear in the void, appearing grabbing the spear when they come back.

Originally thought to be a cursed heirloom because, when thrust in melee range, it would blink the user out and back in a similar position, making it easy to predict where they would reappear at. Also, the blinking in and out was very disruptive to standard combat manuevers.

Awoomoon’s wolf husband was the one who originally discovered its true power and adapted his fighting style to accommodate it.

# Epaulette of The High One

Cat

Fancy shoulder pads connected together. When placed on the ashes of a person, it brings the ashes together to reform and resurrect that person. Any non-burn wounds they had are now healed.

Only works on ashes, not on dead bodies.

The High One used this heirloom on himself to become virtually immortal, allowing him to start and rule the Cat Kingdom for centuries.
