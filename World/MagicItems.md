# Boots of Retriyoan

Cat

These boots were made by Retriyoan to prevent fall damage. When she died, she empowered the boots to also negate all outgoing sound, rendering the wearers indetectable by ears.

Worn by Pantrinome when she raided the wolf village for revenge, and fixed up and modified by Ersatzica.

## Rules

### Requirements

In order to activate its effect, these requirements must be met:

1.  The wearer must be able to fit a limb inside the boots and latch it such that the limb can not simply slide out
2.  At least one boot must be worn
3.  At least one latch must be latched, and that latched latch must be on a boot that is being worn

The following are not requirements:

1.  Both boots be worn
2.  Both latches be latched
3.  Both boots be in proximity to each other
4.  The limb in the boot is a foot
5.  The wearer is a cat (or species the boot is made to fit)
6.  The boot was put on by the wearer (someone else may force the boot on)
7.  The boot was latched by the wearer (someone else may latch it)
8.  The wearer is alive
9.  The wearer is animate (inanimate objects can wear the boots)

#### Ship of Thesius

The boots can be taken apart (and they do get taken apart by Ersatzica). Each piece contains a part of Retriyoan’s essence. If each piece could individually satisfy the requirements, they could each on their own provide the same effect that the whole boot does. However, because most pieces can’t be worn and/or latched on their own, they do not satisfy the requirements in order to activate the effect. The gears can’t be worn (no, wearing it like a button doesn’t count), nor can they be latched. The mouth of the boot can be worn, but it can’t be latched by itself (tho you could install a separate set of latches on it to satisfy this requirement). The latches can be latched, but can’t be worn (tho you could install them on a separate set of boots to satisfy this requirement).

So yes, you could ship of thesius the Boots of Retriyoan. However, I dislike the idea of doing so.

### Effects

The boots negate sound coming from the wearer. The point of origin for this effect comes from the wearer, not the boots. The wearer has an aura around them that negates sound. Things they wear, and things in their pockets, and things they’re holding don’t make sound. If they’re holding a bag of coins, or have the coins in their pocket, the coins won’t make sound, even though they aren’t directly touching the coins.

The boots only block outgoing sound, not incoming sound. This means that the wearer can still hear noises around them.

In addition to sound negation, the boots negate fall damage, which is what they were originally designed to do.

## Description

*It was shaped like a thick hind leg of a cat, but at the bottom, it had a steel plate that attached to the underside of the boot via springs and a piston. The underside of the plate held remnants of some kind of material that had since decayed. Straight gears and round gears worked in unison to let the boot slide forward and backward on the plate. A pulley system with a missing string could have potentially wound from a winch in the front, up the sides, and into a pull string at the lip of the boot. Two latches sealed the boot together, and widened the mouth of the boot when sprung open. The golden trim stretched from the circular lip of the boot, down the underside, and pulled up over the top for the toe protector.*

*Ersie noticed a tension bolt on the heel. She focused in on it. It had gears on its head, that moved two gold-plated straight gears open or closed around the heel. She played with it, and noted that they indeed changed the size of the boot, to a limited degree.*

# Wolf Skin of Monassus

Wolf

A wolf skin that turns a non-wolf into a wolf.

*And in the dim glow of the lantern light, in the center of the floor, lied a fur pelt of a black and white wolf.*

When a non-wolf puts it on, it merges with their body and turns them into a wolf. Specifically, it makes them look like Monassus. It changes what is there to look like Monassus. It does not add or remove anything. If the wearer is missing half their tail as a non-wolf, they’ll still be missing half their tail as a wolf wearing this skin. If the wearer has non-wolf features such as antlers as a non-wolf, they’ll still have antlers as a wolf wearing this skin.

There is no apparent way to take the wolf skin off. However, the wolf skin will detach itself and turn the wearer back to normal when the wearer desires to be a non-wolf animal, or desires to no longer be a wolf.

If the wearer wears the wolf skin for a long period of time, they will still age as though they didn’t wear the wolf skin.

It can be Ship of Theseus’d, but the new pieces don’t gain any magic properties.
