# Ersatzica Characters

This document is for keeping track of details of the characters in Ersatzica's story.

# Ersatzica

Main character

*A slender, black and white wolf pulls a strap tight around her waist.*

Aka Ersie, ‘Nic

Is actually a cat disguised as a wolf.

*Her stomache fur was still white. She turned and examined her hips. Orange fur was creeping up her side, leaving darker stripes in their wake. This is an unusual fur pattern for a wolf. She grabbed a hold of her tail, now that she had a passable ability to balance. It was long, slender, and orange with dark orange stripes. A tuft of red fur tipped the end of it.*

# Mudrich

Ersatzica's wolf sister

*A shorter, stockier, white wolf punched the air in front of her, incidentally shaking off some of the caked mud that had accumulated on her fur.*

# Lemilay

Ersatzica's "older" wolf sister

*Her grey and white fur blurred with the background, but the bald spot on her head was still clearly visible.*

# Wryonin

Ersatzica's wolf brother

*A black and grey wolf stretched his muscles, flexing them with each drum beat.*

# Awoomoon

Ersatzica's wolf mother

*Mother opened their bedroom door without knocking. A tall black and white wolf, her figure occupied the majority of the small doorframe. Her eyes were focused with intent. Her mouth betrayed no sign of a smile. The necklace dangling from her neck consisted of a single canine tooth. Her chest fur was neatly brushed. Her tail was half the length that it should have been.*

aka Huripka (as a young wolf)

# Awsoodoo

Awoomoon’s peacock best friend growing up.

# Soofawkoo

Awsoodoo’s father. Peacock.

# Frestiyen

Awoomoon’s father. Wolf.

# Medic Lersha

Bear medic. She resides in the peacock village.

*A bear a head taller than Dad walked into the room. She wiped her fire-burnt palm on her medic apron.*

*Her frown was accentuated by a long saber tooth protruding from her upper jaw, which was trickle bleeding from the gum.*

# Fisher

Cat fisherman. Rescued Ersatzica from the river, and was her entry point into cat culture. Dates Ersatzica.

# Callustar

(formerly Coach Ynndor)

Wolf training coach. Awoomoon’s older brother. Ersatzica’s uncle. War veteran.

*The wolf at the head of the formation led them in stretches. He was missing an arm. Nevertheless, his tall stature and muscular frame combined with his scowling face made him rather intimidating.*

# Orent

Wolf carpenter. Awoomoon’s younger brother. Ersatzica’s uncle. Filled the carpenter role because Awoomoon banished the previous carpenter. Built Ersatzica’s bunk, walled up the secret barracks room, and designed the lookout posts.
