Christmas 2025 Episode

Gift Giving

Hello! Welcome to the Church of Agranari.

Let’s begin with a short prayer. I’m going to pray to aDirada-Do, but you may pray to another god.

Deer aDirada-Do, thank you for being there for us when we need you. Please help open our minds today to consider others’ points of view and reconsider our own positions. And please help us see and understand one another. Thank you.

So, onto today’s topic. Gift giving! Who doesn’t like giving gifts, especially around Christmas time! But, you may ask, what kind of gift should you give to your friends? A funny gift, a useful gift, or just plain old hard cash? There’s lots of factors to dig into, but we won’t cover all of it today.

You could give your friend anything, really. Like your one old lonely shoe under bed, or the week-old sandwich you forgot to eat in your fridge. But that wouldn’t be a good gift now, would it? It would satisfy the minor rabbit god of speed and efficiency, but I don’t think your friend would like it.

Ajig, the Cat God of Happiness and Peace, would recommend you get your friend whatever would make them smile or laugh. Be it a gag gift, a plushie, or simply a friendly visit or phone call.

Abrazo, the Bear God of Compassion and Love, would ask you to think from their point of view, and think about what they would want or need.

Apsunil, the Beaver God of Hardwork and Rest, would recommend a practical gift, one that helps them with work and/or resting.

Together, Abrazo and Apsunil recommend a gift that fits their needs and improves their life in a material way. Think about what your friend does on a day-to-day basis, and what problems and inconveniences they run into that can be solved with a simple gift. For example, if they have to stumble through the dark to find a light switch often, a flashlight could help keep them from tripping on their cat. If they like to ride bicycles or motorbikes, and often run out of air in their tires, a handheld electronic airpump could be just what they need, but didn’t know it.

aDirada-Do, the Deer Goddess of Truth and Nature, would recommend that you just ask your friend what they want for a gift. This is where Christmas Wish Lists come in handy, for those friends who want to gift you something but don’t know what. Picking something on your friend’s wishlist will work just fine, and then you know it’s something they want.

But sometimes they might need something, that they don’t know they need. And that’s when you follow Abrazo’s and Apsunil’s advice, if you feel you know your friend well enough.

The simple way of explaining how to do this, is to just spend time with your friend, preferably in a place they spend a lot of time in, so you can see them in their natural element. Take note of anything that might cause them irritation, time loss, or inconvenience. And then brainstorm a way to solve that problem. If that problem can be solved with a simple gift, then you’ve got the perfect gift idea!

I’ve used this method to buy gifts for my family and friends and I’ve gotten a lot of comments from people about how often they use the gifts I gave them and how much it helps. To me, that’s the best kind of gift you can give.

You could give cash, but like, why? If I give you \$20 and you give me \$20, we just basically did nothing. Unless we sent it over VenMo or something, then we just lost money (don’t quote me on that, I don’t know how VenMo works). So there’s no real point in sending cash, unless it’s specifically requested or one party isn’t expected to give anything (like with a grandparent sending money to a grandchild). But assuming you and your friend are adults, there’s no point.

Gift cards are similar. If I give you a \$20 Barnes & Noble gift card and you give me a \$20 Best Buy gift card, we basically did nothing except break even, but with restrictions on where we can spend our money now. But! The thing is with gift cards, you cant spend it on bills, so you have guilt-free free reign to spend it on whatever you want. So, gift cards are the slightly better alternative to cash, for those friends who you don’t know what to buy for. The minor rabbit god of speed and efficiency recommends this.

The minor raccoon god of resourcefulness recommends regifting something you have but don’t want anymore. Waste not, want not, I suppose.

Awyoo, the Peacock God of Perfection and Beauty, would recommend creating something yourself with personal meaning. But! As he always says, “If you do, perfect.” You have to make it perfect, lol. Idk, as a follower of aDirada-Do, I would say it doesn’t have to be perfect, it just has to come from the heart.

Alpha, the Wolf God of the Loyal Moon, doesn’t have much advice, except prioritize getting the best gift for the ones you love and care about the most, ie the ones you are most loyal to.

I personally, prefer Abrazo’s method, and have used it to great effect in the past. And to discover what my friend needs but doesn’t know they need, I have to do some investigation, which is aDirada’s domain. So, to close us out, I will end with a prayer geared to doing just that. Pray with me if you want to.

aDirada-Do, I want to give my friend something they could use. Please help me discover their problems, and help me guide me to the solution. I would appreciate any insight you can grant. Thank you.

Well, that’s that for the Christmas episode. Thank you watching, and I’ll see you next week.

Oh! And if you have any gift giving preferences, traditions, or methods, let me know in the comments below! I’d love to hear about them. Bye now!
