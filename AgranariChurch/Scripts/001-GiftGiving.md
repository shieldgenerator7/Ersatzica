Gift Giving

# Teaser

What kind of gift should you give to your friends? A funny gift, a useful gift, or just plain old hard cash? That’s what we will explore in today’s video!

# Intro

Hello! Welcome to the Church of Agranari. I’m shieldgenerator7, follower of aDirada-Do.

Let’s begin with a short prayer. I’m going to pray to aDirada-Do, but you may pray to another god.

*Deer aDirada-Do, thank you for being there for us when we need you. Please help open our minds today to consider others’ points of view and reconsider our own positions. And please help us see and understand one another. Thank you.*

So, onto today’s topic. Gift giving! Who doesn’t like giving gifts, especially around Christmas time! But, you may ask, what kind of gift should you give to your friends? A funny gift, a useful gift, or just plain old hard cash? Let’s see what some of the gods say about this.

# Topic

## Minor Rabbit God of Speed and Efficiency

Just give your friend something fast, don’t think about it too much. You could give your friend anything, really. Like your one old lonely shoe under bed, or the week-old sandwich you forgot to eat in your fridge. But that wouldn’t be a good gift now, would it?

The obvious fast answer is just cold, hard cash. It’s fast, doesn’t require any thought, and the recipient can spend it on whatever they want. You could give cash, but like, why? If I give you \$20 and you give me \$20, we just basically did nothing. And if one of us gives less than the other, then one person just loses money. So there’s no real point in sending cash, unless it’s specifically requested or one party isn’t expected to give anything (like with a grandparent sending money to a grandchild). But assuming you and your friend are adults, there’s no point.

Gift cards are similar. They’re fast, don’t require much thought, and the recipient can use it on whatever they want. But, if I give you a \$20 Barnes & Noble gift card and you give me a \$20 Best Buy gift card, we basically did nothing except break even, but with restrictions on where we can spend our money now. But! The thing is with gift cards, you can’t spend it on bills, so you have guilt-free free reign to spend it on whatever you want. So, gift cards are the slightly better alternative to cash, for those friends who you don’t know what to buy for. The minor rabbit god of speed and efficiency recommends this.

## Ajig, the Cat God of Happiness and Peace

Ajig would recommend you get your friend whatever would make them smile or laugh. Be it a gag gift, a plushie, or simply a friendly visit or phone call.

## Minor Raccoon God of Resourcefulness

The raccoon god says regifting is good. Pick something you don’t want anymore and regift it to someone. Like an old sweater, an extra pair of pliers, or a family heirloom. So instead of throwing away your old phone when you get a new one, give it to someone who could use it.

## Apsunil, the Beaver God of Hardwork and Rest

Apsunil would recommend a practical gift, one that helps them with work and/or resting. A gift that makes it easier for them to do their job and/or chores.

## Abrazo, the Bear God of Compassion and Love

Abrazo would ask you to think from their point of view, and think about what they would want or need.

Together, Abrazo and Apsunil recommend a gift that fits their needs and improves their life in a material way. Think about what your friend does on a day-to-day basis, and what problems and inconveniences they run into that can be solved with a simple gift. For example, if they have to stumble through the dark to find a light switch often, a flashlight could help keep them from tripping on their cat. If they like to ride bicycles or motorbikes, and often run out of air in their tires, a handheld electronic airpump could be just what they need, but didn’t know it.

The simple way of explaining how to do this, is to just spend time with your friend, preferably in a place they spend a lot of time in, so you can see them in their natural element. Take note of anything that might cause them irritation, time loss, or inconvenience. And then brainstorm a way to solve that problem. If that problem can be solved with a simple gift, then you’ve got the perfect gift idea!

I’ve used this method to buy gifts for my family and friends and I’ve gotten a lot of comments from people about how often they use the gifts I gave them and how much it helps. To me, that’s the best kind of gift you can give.

## aDirada-Do, the Deer Goddess of Truth and Nature

aDirada-Do would recommend that you just ask your friend what they want for a gift. This is where Christmas Wish Lists come in handy, for those friends who want to gift you something but don’t know what. Picking something on your friend’s wishlist will work just fine, and then you know for sure that it’s something they want.

But sometimes they might need something, that they don’t know they need. And that’s when you follow Abrazo’s and Apsunil’s advice, if you feel you know your friend well enough.

## Awyoo, the Peacock God of Perfection and Beauty

Awyoo would recommend creating something yourself with personal meaning. Draw a picture, knit a hat, paint a piece of wood, etc.

## Alpha, the Wolf God of the Loyal Moon

Alpha doesn’t have much advice about the gifts themselves, but more so about who you give to. He says to prioritize getting the best gift for the ones you love and care about the most, ie the ones you are most loyal to.

## Conclusion

I personally, prefer Abrazo’s method, and have used it to great effect in the past. And to discover what my friend needs but doesn’t know they need, I have to do some investigation, which is aDirada’s domain. So, to close us out, I will end with a prayer geared to doing just that. Pray with me if you want to.

*aDirada-Do, I want to give my friend something they could use. Please help me discover their problems, and help guide me to the solution. I would appreciate any insight you can grant. Please give us the info we need to give the most meaningful gifts. Thank you.*

Well, that’s that for the Christmas episode. Thank you watching, and I’ll see you next week.

Oh! And if you have any gift giving preferences, methods, or traditions, let me know in the comments below! I’d love to hear about them. Bye now!
