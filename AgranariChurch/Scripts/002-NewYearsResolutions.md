New Year’s Resolutions

# Teaser

How do you make a good new year’s resolutions? Lots of people make new year’s resolutions, but give up within a month. How do you keep at it?

# Intro

Hello! Welcome to the Church of Agranari. I’m shieldgenerator7, ambassador of aDirada-Do.

Let’s begin with a short prayer. I’m going to pray to Alpha, but you may pray to another god.

*Alpha, Wolf God of the Loyal Moon, thank you for your enduring loyalty, and staying with us through times of trial. Please help us achieve our goals, and give us the determination to see them to the end and the endurance to continue going. May we forever be loyal to you. Awoo.*

# Topic

*Awoo!*

Sorry, I couldn’t help myself. It’s the first Alpha-centric episode! I’m so excited!

So what is a New Year’s Resolution? As an American, a New Year’s Resolution is a tradition on new year’s day in which people make a goal for themselves to accomplish during the new year. Things like losing weight, paying off debt, going to the gym more, and learning a new hobby are common new year’s resolutions. Things that are about improving one’s own life, creating good habits, and breaking bad habits. That’s what New Year’s Resolutions are about.

But a new year’s resolution isn’t something you accomplish in one day, no no. It’s something you need to stick to and adhere to day after day after day. And that’s hard. Only 9% of people who make a new year’s resolution actually complete it all the way through the year.[^1] And that makes Alpha… sad.

As the god of loyalty, Alpha wants you to be loyal. Not just to your friends and family, but to yourself and your promises. And what is a new year’s resolution, if not a promise to yourself that you’ll do better?

Usually when you make a promise, you make it to another person. For example, promising to help them with babysitting on a certain day, making marriage vows, or promising to play by the rules in a game of Aggravation (that’s a board game). If that promise is broken, then not only would you know about it, but the other person would also know about it too. And breaking a promise breaks trust, and you don’t want to break trust with that person, so you keep your promise to keep that other person’s trust. But when you make a promise to yourself, the only one who would ever know is yourself. And if you know about when you break the promise, you don’t feel like you’re breaking trust with yourself. And you’re less incentivized to keep that promise, and promises to yourself are easily broken.

So in order to make promises to yourself that you can’t as easily break, you need someone to hold you accountable. That’s where a new years resolution buddy comes into play. A new years resolution buddy is someone who will keep you accountable throughout the year. Find a new years resolution buddy that you trust, and schedule regular meetings to discuss your progress. In these meetings, tell them to what degree you’ve kept your promise to yourself, and to what degree you have failed. And then tell them how you’re going to proceed until the next meeting. Mention any changes you will make to ensure you stay true to your promise. Here’s how this meeting could go:

>   Cirema: “I’m trying to quit drinking soda pop.”  
>   Bartelix: “How you doing on that?”  
>   Cirema: “I used to drink 3 cans a day, but this week I’ve only drank 2 cans a day.”  
>   Bartelix: “Good job!”  
>   Cirema: “Except for Tuesday, when I drank 4 cans in one day.”  
>   Bartelix: “That’s not good. How will you do better next week?”  
>   Cirema: “I’m going to drink only 2 cans a day everyday, and then the week after that I’ll drink only 1 can on one of the days.”  
>   Bartelix: “Sounds good. I’ll hold you to that. Keep up the good work.”

Cirema is trying to cut down on soda pop, and has been doing well most of last week, and Bartelix celebrates that progress with her. But Cirema also failed on Tuesday, so Bartelix holds her to account. And finally Cirema tells him how she’s going to make improvements for next week. That’s an example of how these progress meetings can go.

By having a regular meeting to discuss resolution progress, it keeps you accountable, and helps you stay committed to your resolution. Because now you have someone else who will know.

And make sure you’re honest too! aDirada-Do, the Deer Goddess of Truth and Nature, says that even if you mess up, you should honestly tell your resolution buddy what happened, just like Cirema. And if you did well, tell them that too. Share your failures and your successes. Honesty is important in these meetings.

Another thing that is important, is to have goals that are actually doable. You’ve probably heard of SMART goals before, but if you haven’t, here’s an overview. SMART is an acronym.

-   S stands for Specific. Specific goals are better than general goals. For example, “Lose weight” is a common goal, but it’s too general. “Lose 50 pounds” is more specific, and that makes it easier to tell when you’ve met you’re goal.
-   M is for Measurable. How will you know if you’re making progress? You have to have some way to measure your progress. “Eat healthier” is hard to measure. How do you measure healthy eating? You could change this to “eat more fruits and vegetables”, and then you can measure it by how many pounds of fruits and vegetables you’ve been eating, and can track that on a daily basis.
-   A is for Achievable. Your goal has to be something you can realistically achieve within your time frame. “Run 1 million miles in a year” probably isn’t realistic. But “Run 300 miles in a year” is way more achievable. Personally, I’ve done this before. Make sure your goal is something you can actually do.
-   R is for Relevant. I don’t know why this one is here, other than to make it so the acronym isn’t “SMAT”. Your goals are your goals, no matter if they’re essential to your well-being or purely frivolous. But ideally, your new years resolution would be something that improves your life in some way.
-   T is for Time-Sensitive. You have to have a deadline. If your goal is “Learn 3 new songs on the piano” you can do that anytime, it could even take you 20 years and you’d eventually achieve it. No. It’d be better to change it to “Learn 3 new songs on the piano by December 16th” so you have a deadline, and you have a sense of when you’ll accomplish your goal by. For new year’s resolutions, the deadline is usually the end of the year. Or for habit forming resolutions, there’s not really a deadline, because it’s something you’re trying to do indefinitely.

Using SMART goals, it makes it easier to tell if you’re making progress, and thus it makes it easier to accomplish your goal, because then you will know if you’re heading in the right direction or not.

Here’s some common goals and an example of how to improve them by making them SMART:[^2]

[^2]: <https://www.statista.com/chart/29019/most-common-new-years-resolutions-us/>

-   “Exercise more” -\> “Walk 2 miles everyday.”
-   “Save more money” -\> “Put \$1000 into savings by the end of the year.”
-   “Eat healthier” -\> “Only eat out at a fastfood restaurant 2 times a week” (as opposed to everyday)
-   “Spend more time with family” -\> “Have a board game night once a week”
-   “Lose weight” -\> “Lose 10 pounds by June 1st” (adjust the number and date to your situation)
-   “Improve job performance” -\> “Make 1 new sale every week”
-   “Be environmentally friendly” -\> “Compost more food waste instead of throwing it away”

Note that there’s many ways to make these vague goals into more specific, focused goals. These are just examples. If your new years resolution is one of these goals, make it more SMART so you have a higher chance of making progress on them.

Speaking of progress, it’s important to track it. Whenever you make progress, or at the end of every day, or whatever works for you, record your progress. You can keep a journal, record a short video, enter data in an excel spreadsheet, use an app that tracks it for you, or other ways. It’s important to have this for when you do your goal progress meetings with your resolution buddy.

For me personally, I keep a spreadsheet that details everytime I’ve made progress on my goals and everytime I’ve messed up. Entering data just makes me so happy, I get a dopamine boost whenever I see that little number go up that means I’m making progress.

Which reminds me, Ajig says that it’s important to reward yourself. Find a little something, even if trivial, that gives you a little boost when you make progress on your goal. Like a little piece of chocolate, checking a date on a calendar, entering the data in a spreadsheet, playing a jingle, etc. This could help give you an extra bit of motivation to do it on a regular basis.

Here's some more food for thought.

-   Although it’s called “new years resolutions”, it doesn’t have to be on new year’s. You can make goals for yourself to improve your life whenever.
-   You’re not obligated to make a new years resolution, it is optional. That said, Apsunil *does* encourage you to make goals and work to accomplish them, because then you’re improving your situation, and fighting back against the forces of entropy. And as Awyoo would say, getting ever closer to the asymptote of perfection.
-   You can have multiple new year’s resolutions. It doesn’t have to be just one.
-   If something’s not working, or if your situation changes, you can adjust your new year’s resolution during the year. Talk with your resolution buddy to make changes that stay true to your original intent without giving up on the goal altogether.

# Conclusion

When you do make goals, including new year’s resolutions, Alpha wants you to stay loyal to them. You can do this more easily by having a new years resolution buddy, having goal checkin meetings, making SMART goals, tracking your progress, and rewarding yourself for sticking to it.

# Ending Prayer

Because a lot of new years resolutions tend to be about improving one’s self and getting into good habits, they tend to be about changing one’s self for the better. To that end, let’s say a prayer to aDirada-Do, who has the power to bend reality, and who can help change us into who we want to be.

*Dear aDirada-Do, thank you for helping us get this far in our personal journies. Please give us the strength to achieve our new year’s resolutions, and help us change ourselves into better versions of ourselves. Through your power, may we become better. Thank you.*

To end the episode, let’s also say a prayer to Alpha, who has the power to see the past, and thus know if we’re being loyal to our goals.

*Alpha, Wolf God of the Loyal Moon, please shine a light to guide us on our path, help us see where we’ve been before, and where we’re going, so we can achieve our goals, and stay loyal to our promises, both to each other, and to ourselves. May we ever be loyal to you. Awoo.*
