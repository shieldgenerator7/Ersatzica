# What is a Lie?

# Teaser

What is a lie? Obviously, when you say something untrue to deceive someone, that’s a lie. But what about other things, like technicalities, omissions, and hyperbole? That’s what we’re going to explore in today’s video!

# Intro

Hello! I’m shieldgenerator7, head buck of aDirada-Do, the Deer Goddess of Truth and Nature. Since truth is her domain, she has a lot to say when it comes to things like lies. Let’s start with a prayer to her.

*Deer aDirada-Do, thank you for your wisdom and guidance, for helping us through our struggles. Please help us be honest with each other, and with ourselves, so that we may grow to be better people and strengthen our bonds with each other. Thank you.*

# Topic

Everyone knows what a lie is, and that you shouldn’t do it, but there’s more to it than that. There’s things that many people don’t consider lies that are, and many things that seem like lies, but actually aren’t. Let’s look at some scenarios.

>   Oopoo: Hey Deg, is it raining outside?

>   teDegano: No, it’s sunny.

>   Oopoo: \*goes outside\*

>   Oopoo: \*comes back in, all wet\*

>   Oopoo: You lied to me!

>   teDegano: …

In this situation, teDegano told Oopoo that it wasn’t raining, but it was. Did teDegano lie?
