New Year’s Resolutions

# Teaser

How do you make a new year’s resolutions? How do you keep at it? Lots of people make new year’s resolutions, but give up within a month. How do you make a new year’s resolution that lasts?

# Intro

Hello! Welcome to the Church of Agranari. I’m shieldgenerator7, follower of aDirada-Do.

Let’s begin with a short prayer. I’m going to pray to Alpha, but you may pray to another god.

*Alpha, Wolf God of the Loyal Moon, thank you for your enduring loyalty. Please help us achieve our goals, and give us the determination to stick with it and the endurance to never quit. May we forever be loyal to you. Awoo.*

# Topic

*Awoo!*

Sorry, I couldn’t help myself. It’s the first Alpha-centric episode! I’m so excited!

So a new year’s resolution isn’t something you accomplish in one day, no no. It’s something you need to stick to and adhere to day after day after day. And that’s hard. Only 9% of people who make a new year’s resolution actually complete it all the way through the year.[^1] That makes Alpha sad.

As the god of loyalty, Alpha wants you to be loyal. Not just to your friends and family, but to yourself and your promises. And what is a new year’s resolution, if not a promise to yourself that you’ll make improvements?

Usually when you make a promise, you make it to another person. For example, promising to help them with babysitting on a certain, promising to never again eat the last slice of their birthday cake, or making marriage vows. If that promise is broken, then not only would you know about it, but the other person would also know about it too. And breaking a promise breaks trust, and you don’t want to break trust with that person, so you keep your promise. But when you make a promise to yourself, the only one who would ever know is yourself. And if you know about when you break the promise, you don’t feel like you’re breaking trust with yourself.

So in order to make promises to yourself that you can’t as easily break, you need someone to hold you accountable. Find a new years resolution buddy who will keep you accountable throughout the year. Schedule regular meetings to discuss your progress. In these meetings, tell them to what degree you’ve kept your promise to yourself, and to what degree you have failed. And then tell them how you’re going to proceed until the next meeting. Mention any changes you will make to ensure you stay true to your promise. By having a regular meeting to discuss resolution progress, it keeps you accountable, and helps you stay committed to your resolution. Because now you have someone else who will know.

And make sure you’re honest too! aDirada-Do, the Deer Goddess of Truth and Nature, says that even if you mess up, you should honestly tell your resolution buddy what happened. And if you did well, tell them that too. Share your failures and your successes. Honesty is important in these meetings.

Another thing that is important, is to have goals that are actually doable. You’ve probably heard of SMART goals, but if you haven’t, here’s an overview. SMART is an acronym.

-   S stands for Specific. Specific goals are better than general goals. For example, “Lose weight” is a common goal, but it’s too general. “Lose 50 pounds” is more specific, and thus more achievable.
-   M is for Measurable. How will you know if you’re making progress? You have to have someway to measure your progress. “Eat healthier” is hard to measure. How do you measure healthy eating? You could change this to “eat more fruits and vegetables”, and then you can measure it by how many pounds of fruits and vegetables you’ve been eating, and can track that on a daily basis.
-   A is for Achievable. Your goal has to be something you can realistically achieve within your time frame. “Run 1 million miles in a year” probably isn’t realistic. But “Run 300 miles in a year” is way more achievable. Personally, I’ve done this before. Make sure your goal is something you can actually do.
-   R is for Relevant. I don’t know why this one is here, other than to make it so the acronym isn’t “SMAT”. Your goals are your goals, no matter is their essential to your well-being or purely frivolous.
-   T is for Time-Sensitive. You have to have a deadline. If your goal is “Learn 3 new songs on the piano” you can do that anytime, it could even take you 20 years and you’d achieve it. No. It’d be better to change it to “Learn 3 new songs on the piano by December 16th” so you have a deadline, and you have a way of seeing how well you’re doing.

Using SMART goals, it makes it easier to tell if you’re making progress, and thus it makes it easier to accomplish your goal, because then you will know if you’re heading in the right direction or not.

Speaking of progress, it’s important to track it. Whenever you make progress, or at the end of every day, or whatever works for you, record your progress. You can keep a journal, record a short video, enter data in an excel spreadsheet, use an app that tracks it for you, or other ways. It’s important to have this for when you do your goal progress meetings with your resolution buddy.

For me personally, I keep a spreadsheet that details everytime I’ve made progress on my goals and everytime I’ve messed up. Entering data just makes me so happy, I get a dopamine boost whenever I see that little number go up that means I’m making progress.

Which reminds me, it’s important to reward yourself. Find a little something, even if trivial, that gives you a little boost when you make progress on your goal. Like a little piece of chocolate, checking a date on a calendar, entering the data in a spreadsheet, playing a jingle, etc. This could help give you a little bit of motivation to do it on a regular basis.

So yeah, that’s new years resolutions. Id like to remind you that you can make goals for yourself to improve your life whenever, it doesn’t have to be on new years. And youre not obligated to make a new years resolution either. I do encourage you to make goals and work to accomplish them, because then you’re improving yourself, and fighting back against the forces of entropy.

# Outro

And when you do make goals, including new year’s resolutions, it’s important to stick to them. You can do this more easily by having a new years resolution buddy, having goal checkin meetings, doing smart goals, tracking your progress, and rewarding yourself for sticking to it.

Because a lot of new years resolutions tend to be about improving one’s self and getting into good habits, they tend to be about changing one’s self for the better. To that end, let’s say a prayer to aDirada-Do, who has the power to bend reality.

*Dear aDirada-Do, thank you for helping us get this far. Please give us the strength to achieve our new year’s resolutions, and help us change ourselves into better versions of ourselves. Through your power, may we become better. Thank you.*

To end the episode, let’s also say a prayer to Alpha, who has the power to see the past, and thus track our progress.

*Alpha, Wolf God of the Loyal Moon, please shine a light to guide us on our path, help us see where we’ve been before, and where we’re going, so we can achieve our goals, and stay loyal to our promises, both to each other, and to ourselves. May we ever be loyal to you. Awoo.*

That’s it for this episode. Thank you for attending. See you next week!

Oh! And if you’d like to share your new year’s resolutions, or methods for sticking to them that have worked for you, id love to hear about them in the comments! Bye for now!
