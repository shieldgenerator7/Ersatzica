> hey lil sis! im writing a story, and theres a character doing guard duty for the first time, and someone else gives her tips to get through it. what tips would you give to someone doing guard duty for the first time?

>> I would say don't let anyone past you unless they have ID (or some world- relevant equivalent), if you see something strange report it to your superior immediately, don't leave your post until their is someone to replace you no matter what happens (including possible diversion emergencies i.e. fires unless they're in the immediate area of your post), maybe put in place some sort of alarm that they can pull in case of an obvious emergency

>> That's all i can think of for now if i think of anything else I'll let you know

> thanks thats very useful

>> Np
