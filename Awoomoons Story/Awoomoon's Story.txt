# Awoomoon's Story

# Chapter 1

_AWOOO!_ A young grey and white wolf howled at the moon in the daylight. "Prey here!" she howled again.

She jumped into the creek from the bank and grabbed at a fish. She missed. The fish wiggled away. She grabbed again, and caught it in her hands! But the fish was slippery, and was able to wiggle out.

She chased this larger-than-normal fish up the creek. The creek's many twists and turns were littered with fallen logs, twigs, and the occasional low foot bridge. She expertly dodged all of them on her quest for the big fish.

She rounded a corner, jumped on the fish, and caught it! She tightened her grip, but the fish still was wiggling out.

_WHACK!_

A stone came out of nowhere and hit the fish straight in the head. It stopped wiggling as a bruise formed next to its eye.

The wolf pup turned to the bank. "Wow! That was a great shot!"

A young peacock stood on the bank with a slingshot. His eyes went wide as he realized that the wolf pup had seen him. He turned around and ran off.

"Wait!" The wolf pup climbed up the bank and ran after. She easily caught him and got in front of him. "Don't run. I'm not going to hurt you. Do you want to be friends?"

The peacock blushed and looked away.

The wolf pup held out a hand. "My name is Huripka. What's yours?"

The peacock looked at her. "Aw… Awsoodoo." He put a winged hand in hers.

"Nice to meet you, Awsoodoo." Huripka licked his wing.

Awsoodoo cracked a smile, which he hid by turning away and sheepishly withdrawing his hand.

Huripka moved into his vision. "Do you want to go catch some more fish?"

He looked at her, and then nodded.

"Great! Let's go!"

They tried the same strategy again. Huripka caught the fish with her hands, and Awsoodoo struck the fish with a rock before it could get away. They caught quite a few more fish. They stopped when Awsoodoo missed and hit the Huripka in the hand.

_AWOOOOO!_ "Injury!" she howled.

Awsoodoo dropped his slingshot and rushed to her side. He wrapped his feathers around her hand and rubbed through them with the underside of his beak.

Huripka stopped howling. She looked down at it. "Wow, that… actually feels better."

Awsoodoo then kissed her hand and patted it gently. He looked into her eyes.

In the distance, peacock sounds came closer.

A look of panic overtook Awsoodoo. He grabbed his slingshot and ran off.

"What is that?" Huripka followed.

"My brothers."

No sooner did he say that, than three older peacocks with fully splayed tails show up. They immediately noticed the wolf pup caressing her hand. "Awsoodoo, did you hurt this poor wolf pup and cause her to howl in pain?"

Awsoodoo froze.

"It was an accident." Huripka cut in.

"So you did!" His oldest brother got up in his face. "How could you?" He pushed him.

"Hey! Leave him alone!" Huripka growled.

"Aw the little doggy is standing up for the cowardly birdy." Another brother knelt in front. "You gonna let this wolf pup fight your battles for you?" He shoved Awsoodoo, knocking him to the ground.

Huripka barked and dove on one of their feet. She grabbed it with her hands and squeezed tight.

"I've been bit! I've been bit!" The peacock ran around screaming, dragging Huripka around.

Huripka let go and let the peacock run off.

The other two brothers stayed. "That wasn't cool. You better run off before a fight starts."

Huripka growled.

"I am trained in Pea-Fo." He swirled his wings gracefully in the air, then made three swift punches.

"I'm good at fighting too!" Huripka barked.

"We'll see about that." The Pea-Fo trained peacock sent a quick punch flying at Huripka.

Huripka didn't see it coming. She got hit straight in the face and went flying back.

The peacock stood over her. "Ha. 'Good at fighting', sure. You're weak." He looked at his younger brother. "Just like your friend. Leave now, wolf pup, while you still can."

A tear formed in Huripka's eye as she sat up. She furrowed her eyebrows and bared her teeth. She growled as she stood back up.

"So be it." He spun around and knocked her on her back with his tail.

Awsoodoo got up and ran over to Huripka, but he got tripped. "Awooo!" He tried to howl, but it didn't come out like he thought.

His older brother grabbed him by the legs and held him upside down. "You really suck at howling."

Huripka propped herself up on her elbows and turned her muzzle towards the moon. _AWOOOO!_ "Injury!" _AWOOOOO!_ "Injury!" Her howls her pitiful but determined. They rang out loud and carried far and wide. They echoed off the trees. _AWOOOO!_

The peacocks looked around hastily. "Shut her up! Shut her up!"

They grabbed her from behind and wrapped a wing around her face.

She opened her jaw and clamped down on it.

"Ow! Ow! Ow!" The peacock held his wing. "I've been bit! I've been bit!"

"Idiot!" The other peacock grabbed her. "You have to hold her like this!" He forced her muzzle shut and wrapped a wing around her muzzle.

She tried to open her mouth, but couldn't. The peacock had a tight grip. She squirmed like a fish and broke free. She grabbed Awsoodoo by the hand and they ran off.

The other peacocks caught up quickly, but by the time they did, they were in sight of some guard wolves.

"What's the trouble? Are you the wolf crying injury?" The wolf guards looked down at Huripka.

"Yes, sir." She nodded.

"Yeah she cried injury!" The older peacock brother cut her off. "We heard her cries too, and when we got to the scene, this runt—" he kicked Awsoodoo. "—was hitting her with rocks." He hid his bit wing behind his back.

Awsoodoo hung his head.

"That's not true! That's not true!"

The guards ignored her. "We'll take it from here. You're free to go."

The peacocks left.

"You two come with us." They escorted Huripka and Awsoodoo to the peacock village. They walked through the market place and to the prison. "We'll hold you two here until your parents come for you." They put them in separate cells.

Huripka looked up at the light shining through the roof. She sat on the bench and crossed her arms. A low growl emanated from her throat.

Awsoodoo grabbed onto the bars and peered his head out between them. "Hu… Huripka?"

"Yeah?"

"I'm sorry… I got you into this."

"No, you're my friend." Her growl subsided. "Friends stick together."

"Friends stick together." Awsoodoo smiled.

# Chapter 2

Huripka and Awsoodoo met every day at the creek to fish and hang out. They ran to the wolf guards whenever they heard Awsoodoo's brothers approaching. This went on for several weeks. Eventually Huripka told her papa about it.

"So you someone is bullying you?" Huripka's papa, a silver and white wolf, stood next to a doorway, scanning the perimeter. His spear hand steadily held it straight up from the ground.

"And my friend too, Papa!" Huripka hugged his stable leg.

"I see. That is quite troublesome."

"What should I do, Papa?" She looked up at the underside of his muzzle with a tear in his eye.

"You shouldn't have to learn this so young." Without looking, her reached down with his free hand and wiped a tear from her eye. He sighed. "But you'd have to learn it someday."

"Learn what, Papa?"

"To defend yourself." He patted her on the head, rubbing behind her ears. "I have a friend who's a master of martial arts."

While Huripka and Awsoodoo were playing by the creek the next day, Papa met with his martial arts friend. They met at a tea shop in the marketplace.

"So, Soofawkoo, my daughter has been having trouble with a bully."

Soofawkoo let his tail feathers spread a bit, letting his grey-eyed feather show. "Well, Fristiyen, there must be something wrong with her."

Fristiyen furrowed his brow but continued nonetheless. "It's time she learned how to defend herself. Do you have any room in your Pea-Fo class?"

"Whether or not I have room, that's not the question." Soofawkoo took a sip of his tea. "Can your daughter keep up?"

Frestiyen grumbled under his breath. "Give her a week, then we'll evaluate from there. Think of it…" He swirled his cup in the air. "Think of it like a challenge."

"Hmmm." Soofawkoo smiled. "I have never trained a wolf before. It shall be an… interesting challenge."

"Then you'll do it?" Frestiyen downed the last of his tea.

"No, I'll perfect it."

The next day, Huripka ran to the creek excitedly.

"Awsoodoo! Awsoodoo! Awsoodoo!" When she found him, she ran up and tackled him. "Guess what Awsoodoo?"

"What?" Awsoodoo answered despondently.

"My dad signed me up for fight class! Wait, what's wrong?"

"My dad's forcing me to take classes."

"What kind of classes?"

"Pea-Fo. But I don't want to fight. I want to play by the creek." He looked at Huripka. "With you."

"Oh you mean fight class! Maybe we'll both be in the same class, and then we can do _that_ together!"

Awsoodoo's eyes brightened. "Yeah! Maybe this won't be so bad. Except…"

"Except what?"

"I'm still going to be in class with my dad."

Huripka and Awsoodoo show up to class the next day to find that the teacher is indeed Awsoodoo's father.

Class took place in a field at the top of a hill, surrounded by a flower garden. Rows and rows of flowers cascaded down the side of the hill. Although there was a wide variety of colors and flower types in this garden, all the flowers immediately on the edge of the clearing were thorned roses. Deer roamed the garden, watering them, pruning them, and planting them.

At the head of the field, the Pea-Fo master stood over his class. "Today class, you will notice we have two new pupils." Soofawkoo pointed a winged hand to Huripka and Awsoodoo.

"A wolf?" The rest of the class, entirely all peacocks, laughed in unison.

"How is she going to do Light From Above?"

"Or Stone Slicer?"

"I want to see her try Woodpecker."

Huripka growled at the mockery.

Soofawkoo shared in the laughter. Then he straightened his face. "Silence! This wolf is now part of our class. It will not be easy training her in the ways of Pea-Fo, but it is up to me, up to you, up to _all of us_ to train her. We have one week."

The class fell silent.

Huripka looked puzzled. "One week?"

"If you don't achieve at least a white-yellow sash by the end of the week, you will be expelled from this class." Soofawdoo ran a feather finger along the black sash hanging tightly around his neck. "Are you up to the challenge?"

Huripka growled with fire in her eyes and took a fighting stance. "I'm up for it."

"Perfect."

Soofawkoo led them first in a series of drills, all of which involved a lot of punches, swipes, tail spins, and other movements that Huripka could easily do, but not perfectly.

"Higher!" Soofawkoo yelled at Huripka when she spun around with her tail extended. "Faster!" He'd yell when she'd punch. "Wider!" He'd say about her stance when she swiped.

They trained for the whole day.

"Do better tomorrow class. Dismissed." Soofawkoo bowed slightly to his class, barely opening with wings.

The class responded by bowing their head as far as they could, and opening their wings as wide as possible. "Yes, master."

Huripka bowed and fell on her face.

The class laughed at her.

"Look! It's that wolf girl! She's eating dirt!" A peacock peeked up over the hill.

"Shh! We're trying to sneak in!"

Three peacocks took their place in class bowing to the master of Pea-Fo.

Huripka's eyes widened and her mouth fell open. The three peacocks were Awsoodoo's older brothers, who had been bullying them.

"Where have you three been?" Soofawkoo scolded.

"Um… we were…" One of them stammered. "Being detained by…" He looked around and landed on Huripka. "A wolf. A wolf taskforce. They wanted to know what we witnessed."

"And what did you witness?"

"Um…"

Soofawkoo didn't let them finish. "That is no excuse. You must arrive on time or lose your place in class."

"Yes master." The three peacocks bowed.

Huripka leaned over to Awsoodoo. "What are _they_ doing here?"

"They're my brothers. Dad wants us all to be fighters. Of course they'd be here."

"I can see why you're not thrilled to be here."

Awsoodoo nodded.

"What are _you_ doing here?" The three brothers encircled the two.

"I'm taking fight class!" Huripka puffed up her chest. "And when I'm done, I'm going to beat you and your tail feathers!"

The peacocks laughed. "_Fight class_? You don't even know the name of the class! It's called Pea-Fo, you know, as in Pea_cock_ Fighting. It's not for females, and it's most definitely not for wolves." He poked Huripka with a sharp feather.

"Boys! It's time to go home." Soofawkoo yelled.

"Well, I have to go home now." Awsoodoo waved goodbye.

"See you tomorrow." Huripka left to go home.

The next day, they trained like normal, this time with Awsoodoo's brothers. They tripped up Huripka and got in her way every chance they could. And by the end of the day, it was clear Huripka wasn't going to earn the first sash. At the end of class, Soofawkoo dismissed everyone but told Huripka to stay. He trained with her until the sun went down.

Soofawkoo sighed. "You're not as capable as I thought you would be. Still, there's five days left. Maybe you'll yet impress me. Dismissed."

Huripka looked down. She kicked a rock that was glowing in the moonlight.

_AWOOOOOO!_ A wolf howled off in the distance. It was Papa's howl! "Where?"

_AWOOO!_ Huripka howled back. "Here!"

Papa came to get her and walked her home. "How is training going?"

"Master says I won't get the first sash on time."

"Even if you don't, you're still my daughter." He kissed the top of her head. "But I know you can do it, no matter what those bullies say."

She hugged him. "Thanks, Papa."

The next five days went by in a blur. Soofawkoo moved Huripka to the front row so she'd be away from the three peacock brothers. The peacocks she stood next to now acted cold towards her, but didn't actively get in her way. She tried her hardest, but a lot of the moves required wings, feathers, and a beak. By the end of the week, things looked bleak.

On the last day she had to prove herself, there was no training. There was only sparring. The new pupils had to prove that they learned the moves, and had to show they could effectively use them on an opponent.

The class was given "neck socks", protective sleeves that went around their necks. They were thick enough to protect against cuts.

Huripka struggled to put hers on. It constricted her breathing and clumped up on her shorter neck. She stopped breathing, and Soofawkoo pulled it off her.

"Well if you can't wear the neck sock, then you will have no protection, and thus are disqualified from the tournament." Soofawkoo ruled.

"I want to compete!"

"But you will die."

"Wolf necks are thicker than peacock necks. And mine is especially thick." She grabbed the scruff of her neck to show how thick it was. "I can compete safely."

"Very well. We will see if you are good enough to survive."

Awsoodoo and Huripka were paired up to showcase their skills.

"Go easy on me?" Huripka asked Awsoodoo.

He looked left and right, but nodded anyway.

"Awsoodoo! Go!"

Awsoodoo punched Huripka rapidly in the chest, swiped her twice with his wing feathers, and then softened his tail feathers for the final move. He spun around and brushed his tail feathers harmlessly across Huripka's neck.

"Pass!" Soofawkoo yelled. "Perfectly executed. You have earned your white yellow sash."

Huripka high-fived Awsoodoo.

"Huripka! Go!"

Huripka curled her fists and sent them flying into Awsoodoo's chest, knocking him off balance. He staggered backwards as she swiped at him, causing her to miss. She stepped forward as she spun, but she lost her center and her spinning tail went wide.

"Fail!" Soofawkoo looked at Huripka angrily. "You have failed to earn your white-yellow sash. It turns out you were not good enough. You are now expelled from this class. You are dismissed."

"But…"

"You are dismissed!"

A tear formed in Huripka's eye and she looked away. "Come on, Awsoodoo." She grabbed his hand as she walked away.

Awsoodoo resisted. "I have to get my white-yellow sash." He pulled his wing back.

She looked in his eyes as another tear formed in hers. His face betrayed no sign of sympathy or distraught. It was all excitement and glee for his success. Huripka froze.

"He said you're dismissed." Awsoodoo pushed her.

She looked back one more time before walking off. Soofawkoo pulled the neck sock off Awsoodoo and replaced it with a thick white sash with a single yellow length-wise stripe. Awsoodoo bowed enthusiastically. Huripka broke into a crying rage as she ran home.

The next day, Huripka sat by the creek and waited. The fish jumped up and down the bends, over the logs, and into the ripples. They taunted her, but she sat on a log on the bank, twiddling a stick in the dirt. Finally, in the late afternoon, a certain peacock strolled in with his white yellow sash.

"I'm here!" He held his head high. "Did you see my new sash? Dad says I did all the moves perfectly, even though I was sparring with a wolf, and that I'll earn my next one in no time!"

"That's great." Huripka curled up, crossing her arms over her knees.

"Well it was nice seeing you, Huripka, but I have to go to dinner. I'm super hungry after training today. See you tomorrow!"

As Awsoodoo walked away, Huripka didn't say goodbye. Instead, she cried.

# Chapter 3

It was a long time before Awsoodoo met Huripka at the creek again. This time he came back with a yellow sash, proudly holding his beak high.

Huripka abruptly stopped what she was doing, which was a haphazard subset of the drills and moves she learned in that one week. "Awsoodoo."

"I earned this by perfectly executing the next set of moves." He ran a feather down along the sash.

"That's great, Awsoodoo."

"Father says I'll get my black belt in no time at this rate."

"Great…"

"It's too bad you didn't even earn a white-yellow belt."

"Yeah…" Huripka tossed a stone into the creek. "Hey you wanna go fishing?"

"No, I have to practice my moves." His eyes widened. "We could do them together!"

"Mmm, sure."

Awsoodoo showed her his new moves, and she practiced blocking them so he could learn them better. Things were going well, and they were both having fun by the end of it. But then it happened again. Awsoodoo's brothers showed up.

"Hey it's that wolf who thought she was a peacock."

"Yeah what kind of wolf would try to fight like a peacock?"

"Still haven't forgiven you for what you did to my wing."

"What did I do?" Huripka raised an eyebrow.

"Nothing." He recanted.

"He didn't go to the doctor after you bit him and now it's getting infected."

"Shh!" He hissed. "Well, yeah. And now it hurts like crazy, and it's so hard to hide it _and_ fight Pea-Fo."

"Just go to the doctor bro!"

"No, I can't let anyone know I got bit by a wolf pup! And you better keep quiet about it too!"

"Sure thing."

"You're weak to wolf bites?" Huripka bared her teeth. "Well you better stay away! Unless you want another one!"

"I don't want to get bit!"

"Me neither!"

"Well then it's a good thing now we got yellow sash here." He pushed Awsoodoo. "He'll take care of this wolf pup right, Awsoodoo?"

"Yeah Awsoodoo!"

Huripka looked at him. "You wouldn't."

Awsoodoo looked left and right. "I… I…" He looked at the ground.

Then with a sudden swiftness, he uppercut her muzzle and tail swiped her chest.

She fell backward onto the dirt. "Awsoodoo?"

Awsoodoo looked down. "Sorry, Huripka."

She turned her attention to the three brothers, pointing at all three of them. "You!" She got off the ground. "I'm going to tell everyone about your wing!" She turned around and ran off.

"But if you do that…" The brothers called out.

Huripka stopped in her tracks. She faced them. "What?"

"If you tell anyone about the wing." They stroked Awsoodoo's head menacingly. "Your friend here gets hurt. Irrecoverably."

"Irre… Irre-what?"

"You can't undo it once it's done."

"What friend are you talking about?" Awsoodoo looked up, but they forced his head back down. "You're not talking about me, are you?"

"Of course not, yellow sash brother."

"Fine." Huripka growled. "I won't tell, and you don't harm him."

"Deal." They smiled. "Come on, yellow sash brother, let's go to the special fish pond."

"Can Huripka come too?"

They laughed. "It's peacocks only."

They all four left Huripka alone in the clearing by the creek. She burned in anger and loneliness.

Weeks went by. She trained by herself as much as she could, perfecting the first three moves she learned the best she could. Awsoodoo was hardly there, and when he was, he was accompanied by his brothers. Despite them hazing him and harassing her, Awsoodoo was content to become their groupie.

They blackmailed her into letting them beat her up. She'd block as best she could, but sometimes they got through. Most times she could just shrug it off, but occasionally she would come home with a bruise or cut. She explained it away as "rough housing in the undergrowth".

Months went by. Awsoodoo frequently carried a new sash of a higher status. And his moves got faster and more potent. Every time Huripka learned to consistently block his attacks, he'd learn new ones that tripped her up.

Years went by. Huripka and Awsoodoo grew taller. Huripka's skin and bones thickened and her growl got louder. Awsoodoo's neck gained brilliant new colored feathers and his tail grew splendid. He even got his grey-eyed tail feather. These bodily changes took time for both to adjust to, but they trained through them, maintaining their combat prowess.

Finally it was time for brown-sashed Awsoodoo to earn his black sash. But to do so, he had to win a Pea-Fo tournament. The combatants were all brown sashes or lower. Whoever won the tournament earned their black sash. The tournament was held whenever there were enough brown sashes to have one, maximum of once per month.

All the brown-sashed peacocks in Soofawkoo's class signed up, as did some lower-tier sashes, and some independent candidates.

"Name?" The peacock at the table didn't look up as he moved the pen to the next blank line on the paper.

The next contestant approached the table, casting a peculiar non-peacock shadow on the attendant. "Huripka."

The attendant scoffed. "That's not a peacock name. You need a peacock name."

Huripka looked around, and saw the moon in the daylight sky. "Moon."

"That's only one syllable!"

"Moon, Awooo… Awoomoon!"

"Awoomoon?"

"Yes."

"Ok." The attendant gave her a number. "Make sure to wear this during combat."

"Ok what now?"

"Next!" he shoved her along.

The next day, when the attendants had arranged everybody into brackets, Huripka faced her first competitor in the ring.

She stood face to face with a peacock with a blue-brown sash. He looked confused, unsure how to apply Pea-Fo to a wolf opponent. Huripka gave him a toothy grin. In response, he checked to make sure his neck sock was on. Huripka raised her chin, showing her sockless neck.

The caster spoke with a booming voice. "Here we have two first-time competitors, both vying for the black sash. In this corner we have Ootawroo, an independent trainee with a blue-brown sash, just one shy of the max you can get without a tournament. But feeling prepared, he enters with high confidence!"

The crowd cheered. Two or three peafowls cheered the hardest, most probably his family.

"And in this corner—" The caster stammered. "What do we have here? Awoomoon, a wolf? With a sash of color… oh actually she has no sash."

The crowd laughed and jeered.

"That's right, fowl! This wolf entered a peacock tournament with no prior experience! This should be an easy fight for Ootawroo!"

The crowd cheered at the mention of his name.

"Now let's go to the referee to start this match."

The referee stood just on the outside of the circle, placing the two competitors on opposite sides within the ring. "Slice the neck sock, score a point. Knock the opponent out of the ring, score a point. First to three points wins. Flying ok, petrification banned. Round 1: Go!"

Huripka wasted no time crossing the arena. She closed in on Ootawroo faster than he expected, punching him straight in the chest. He staggered back, stepping outside the circle.

"Point: Awoomoon!" The referee raised his right wing. "Places!"

Huripka jogged back to her spot. Ootawroo spat outside the arena, then cautiously approached his spot.

"Wow! What a start! This wolf might be more capable than we thought!"

The referee yelled, "Round 2: Go!"

Huripka charged and punched, but this time Ootawroo shot straight up into the air, dodging her completely. She managed to stop herself before running off the edge of the ring, but she was in a bad position. Ootawroo landed on her shoulders and pushed her down, landing her outside the ring.

"Point: Ootawroo!" The referee raised his left wing. "Places!"

"Is that all she's got? Ootawroo easily saw that coming."

Back at there places, Huripka stared into Ootawroo's eyes. He met her gaze for but a moment before turning away.

"Round 3: Go!"

Huripka ran at him again, and he flew up in the air again, as she expected him too. Instead of stopping her run, she jumped in the air and spun around, swinging her tail into Ootawroo. He blocked it with his wings, but it stunned him enough to make him drop to the ground. On the way down, he held out his beak right over Huripka's skull. She dodge rolled away, landing on all fours. Ootawroo switched positions and landed feet first, taking only a moment to reorient. But that was all Huripka needed. She lunged at him, swiping with both paws at the same time. They hit the neck sock.

"Point: Awoomoon!" The referee raised his right wing. "Places!"

"What a stunning display! Awoomoon actually jumped to Ootawroo's fleight height! This could go either way!"

This time, Ootawroo stared intently back at Huripka. He blinked before he could get her to look away.

"Round 4: Go!"

Huripka lunged at Ootawroo, preparing to swipe. But at the last moment, he turned around, and splayed his brilliant tail feathers. Huripka landed in them and onto his back. Just like he planned. He flapped his wings with one powerful flap, launching himself into the air and an unexpected angle, causing him to flip in the air, and come down upside-down beak first onto Huripka. He was quick enough that she didn't have time to dodge. He connected his beak with the back of her neck.

"Point: Ootawroo!" The referee raised his left wing. "Places!"

"Wow that was incredible! Yet again, Ootawroo took advantage of Awoomoon's predictable moves to do something unexpected. He really shows off the unique perfections of the peacock body."

Huripka rubbed her neck, but her gaze didn't waver. Ootawroo gulped.

"Round 5: Go!"

Huripka lunged again. Ootawroo blocked it this time, or he would have. But Huripka only short-lunged, stopping just in front, and dodge rolling to the side. Once there, she tail swiped him to the side. Ootawroo was knocked over, but he channeled it into a roll onto his back. Huripka jumped onto him, but he pushed her off with his clawed feet. Huripka moved a paw into position midari so that it would land on his neck. He saw it coming and paddled out of the way. Huripka landed on all fours. Ootawroo got back on his feet as fast as he could, but by the time he did, Huripka was already there with a sprinting punch. This sent him staggering to the edge of the arena. He used his wings to slow his momentum, keeping himself in the arena. Huripka jumped at him with two swipes and a tail spin. He blocked it all with his winged feathers, then went for a winged uppercut. Huripka leaned her head to the side, dodging it. With his wing outstretched, she leaned over and punched him right in the neck. He gagged for a moment.

"Point: Awoomoon! Winner: Awoomoon!"

"Wow what a turn out! Even though this wolf only knows three moves, she sure knows how to use them!"

"Awoomoon! Awoomoon! Awoomoon!" The crowd cheered. Or at least, part of it. Huripka didn't look to see.

Awoomoon advanced up the tournament, defeating a green sash, a blue sash, and even a brown sash, which was a major upset.

The only brown sash left to face her in the tournament was Awsoodoo. He climbed through the bracket, landing him in the final match against Awoomoon.

"In this corner we have Awsoodoo, a first-time competitor. Waiting until he had his brown sash, Awsoodoo excels at perfecting the moves he learns, earning him this place in the tournament. Once he wins, he'll perfect his black sash and the moves beyond."

"Aw-soodoo! Aw-soodoo! Aw-soodoo!" His brothers and others in the crowd chanted his name, even as the caster tried to hype up the other contestant.

"And here we have Awoomoon, the unknown surprise wolf contestant who happens to be surprisingly good at peacock combat. No one expected this to be the final fight, fowls, but here it is!"

"Places!"

Huripka smiled. "Hey Awsoodoo!"

"Huripka? How did you get this far?"

"You're not the only one who's been training."

"Hmmm." He smirked. "Sure, but I bet you won't put up much of a fight."

"We'll see."

"I mean, you _won't_ put up much of a fight." He shrugged. "I've watched your fights. I know all your moves. All three of them."

"Round 1: Go!"

Awsoodoo blocked, bracing for a charge punch. When that didn't happen, he looked around. Huripka was standing at her spot, staring menacingly at him.

"Looks like we got a bit of a stand off here! Neither combatant wants to make the first move!"

"What are you doing?" Awsoodoo whispered vehemently, putting down his blocking stance.

"Like you said, not putting up much of a fight."

Awsoodoo's eyes widened. "Oh." He smiled.

Awsoodoo went in for the attack. He used all his brown-sash moves on her, executing them perfectly. He flew up into the air and dived beak-first. Huripka dodge rolled. He clamped his feet into the ground, spread his wings, and flapped. The wind burst blew Huripka back, but she hunkered down and clawed the ground, losing no ground. He flapped up and dove feet first into her shoulder. She raised an arm and his claws latched onto that instead of her neck. In response, he twirled with wings, spinning him around, and thus dragging Huripka into the spin. She tiptoed on the ground, graciously directing the momentum. He finished with a downward dive into the dirt, and she landed on all fours, ready to attack. Preparing for a counterattack, Awsoodoo landed with tail feathers facing Huripka. Displaying them, he would defend a lunge attack, if only Huripka would oblige. And she did. She jumped onto his back, landing helplessly into his tail feathers instead. Awsoodoo flapped and flipped into the air, landing his beak onto Huripka's neck in one quick motion. Except, she dodge rolled and avoided it. Awsoodoo pulled his neck up and corrected his trajectory to amazingly not only land on his feet, but also face his opponent.

"What is this? A fight or a dance? These moves look way to practiced to be a spur-of-the-moment combat between two fighters."

Huripka took a fighting stance. Awsoodoo motioned for her to come forward. She ran at him and lined up a punch to his neck. He blocked, spun around, and swiped his tail feathers to her neck. She ducked. Her ears barely managed to come out uncut. At the end of the spin, he had an uppercut waiting for her. She side stepped it and punched him in the neck. He recoiled in surprise.

"Point: Awoomoon!" The referee raised his right hand. "Places!"

"Shocking! Desptie Awsoodoo performing all the moves perfectly, Awoomoon dodges all of them! Without wings or tail feathers! And then dodges one final time and follows up with a counter attack!"

"A-woo-moon! A-woo-moon! A-woo-moon!" Part of the crowd cheered.

"Huripka, that was a sloppy punch!" Awsoodoo scolded. "You have to connect the _center_ of your fist to the neck!"

"Thanks, I'll remember that for next time."

"Round 2: Go!"

Another round like the last. Awsoodoo attacked Huripka, who expertly dodged all of them. At the end, she found an opening and took it. This time with a solid punch to the neck, _with_ the center of her fist.

"Point: Awoomoon!" The referee raised his right wing. "Places!"

"This is match point for Awoomoon! She's close to shutting out the favored winner altogether!"

"Huripka! What are you doing?" Awsoodoo complained.

Huripka just looked at him as she got back into position.

"You're making me look bad."

"Oh, are you not so perfect without your little black sash?" She sneered.

"Huripka, _please_. I need this."

Her steel gaze fizzled out. She looked down to her right. Then she looked back at him and nodded.

"Round 3: Go!"

Huripka ran at him with a charge punch. He blocked it, but still got knocked back. He spread his wings to prevent getting out of bounds. He counter attacked by digging his claws in the dirt and flapping one powerful flap. Huripka leapt into the air, taking it in full force, getting knocked down and knocked back. She landed on her back, head outside the ring.

"Point: Awsoodoo!" The referee raised his left wing. "Places!"

"Astounding! Despite getting hit hard by that swift attack by Awoomoon, Awsoodoo was able to keep from getting ring'd out and even knocked his opponent out instead! Amazing! This fight isn't lost yet!"

"What was that?" Awsoodoo complained.

"You want to win, don't you?"

"You gotta make it believable or else it won't count!"

Huripka grumbled.

"Round 4: Go!"
