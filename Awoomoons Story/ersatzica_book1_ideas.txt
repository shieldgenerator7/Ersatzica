plot point idea:

mudrich finds out about the cat outpost, and raids it, killing lots of cats and destroying it
she did it bc shes bloodthirsty, but also bc either
a. shes mad at ersie becoming more catlike, and did it to get back at her
b. she sees the outpost as the source of ersie's betrayal, and wants to help her get back to being a wolf, so mudrich decides to destroy the outpost

as a result of this, ersie goes into a rage, tells mudrich all the bad things she thinks about mudrich, and they have a small feud

perhaps they have a physical fight where mudrich almost kills cat ersie
