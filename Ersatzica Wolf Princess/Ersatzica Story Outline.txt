# Ersatzica Story Outline

I just found this video online: [https://youtu.be/fe3eodLF\_Uo](https://youtu.be/fe3eodLF_Uo) It's really inspiring. So I'm going to use it outline Ersatzica's story. I was thinking about doing this for tePeshabi instead, but I don't really know what the inciting incident is of that story, and I'm still trying to figure out what that story is about. So I'm going to do it for a story I have developed a lot more. Anyway here is the outline, as shown in the video.

Act 0

1. Pantrinome invades wolf tribe, gets killed, loses 3 of 4 newborn kittens, Awoomoon also gives birth.

Act 1

1. Ersatzica, Mudrich, Wryonin, Lemilay all go to fend off cats invading on their shore, track them down and retrieve what they stole, among which is the Boots of Retriyoan. Or maybe Ersatzica tunes up their gear but does not join them, instead watches from afar.
2. Ersatzica finds the boots they brought back while working on her mother's bed. She's late to fixing it because she got distracted with her own projects and her mother comes back before she can finish. Ersatzica finds out the boots are silent, steals them, and brings them back to her workshop. She messes around with them and turns into a cat, allowing her to fit into the boots.
3. Ersatzica freaks out, and stumbles around. She takes off to avoid the other wolves, but they see her and chase her out of the village. Awoomoon swoops in and saves her, telling the village that the boots magically transformed her into a cat, and telling her in front of the whole village that the boots were important, and that it was her mission to modify the boots for wolf legs. Ersatzica accepts.
4. Ersatzica requests to be assigned to other projects, but is sent to a remote workshop where she can work on the boots without being glared at by the other wolves. A bodyguard is posted there to keep her safe, and to help assist her with the project, and to keep her in the faith. "What ever you do Ersatzica," her mother looked deep into her eyes. "Remember that the Wolf Goddess of the Moon loves you." (this kind of talk will definitely make the wolves seem religious).
5. Ersatzica makes lots of progress on discovering the nuances of the boots, and studies feline anatomy.
6. Ersatzica finds some cat fisherman and they gawk at her and bow. She sits and listens to them and learns a little about their culture.
7. Awoomoon finds out through the body guard, and pressures Ersatzica to ask them about the cats' invasion plans.
8. Ersatzica takes off the boots among the cat fisherman and finds out that she can be a cat without the boots, and when she asks them about the invasion, they tell her she's the princess so they'd probably know better than them.
9. Ersatzica borrows books from the fisher cats, learns more about cat philosophy and mechanics, all behind the guise of working on the boots.

Act 2

1. Ersatzica delves into knowledge, and spends more and more time in the boots as an excuse to live as a cat, she learns all about how to climb trees and sharpen her claws, how to bathe herself, and other things.
2. She encourages her body guard to try them, and convinces him that it will help her figure out how to modify the boots. However, the boots don't work for him, but he eventually expresses interest. But ends up telling Awoomoon everything, betraying his promise to Ersatzica.
3. Wryonin, Mudrich, Lemilay are sent to ward off cats reportedly fishing at the river. Ersatzica warns them and covers for them.
4. Awoomoon becomes impatient about Ersatzica's lack of progress. Next Lemilay catches Ersatzica genuinely enjoying the cats' company, and blackmails Ersatzica into promising to turn down the Chieftess position, if she gets it offered to her. Mudrich finds the fisher cats and scares them off. Wryonin lectures Ersatzica into focusing more on her assignment.
5. Ersatzica realizes that she is actually a cat, and has been all along. Awoomoon tells her everything about her origin, but asserts that shes still a wolf, and always will be.
6. Ersatzica runs back to the fisher cats, who are now being guarded by armored cat warriors. They chase Ersatzica away and take her wolf skin.
7. Ersatzica runs back to Awoomoon, and tells her that she was right about the cats not accepting her, and that she should remain loyal to the wolves.
8. Ersatzica modifies the boots for wolf anatomy. Faces a lot of stigma for her "curse", as Awoomoon called it.
9. Awoomoon sends a strike team out with the boots, and they capture their target, the fisher cats. Ersatzica is regarded as a hero for her engineering skills, despite her being a cat.

Act 3

1. Ersatzica finds a new freedom, being allowed to work on tasks at will and roam around without any stigma. But she also finds that she prefers to be a cat, and enjoys her new set of learned cat behaviours.
2. Ersatzica is arrested for being an imposter, as the "real" Ersatzica "comes back" and claims she was kidnapped. It's really another cat wearing the Wolfskin of Monassus, but Awoomoon and the wolf tribe fully believe it. Ersatzica is imprisoned, and her siblings treat her like scum.
3. Ersatzica feels betrayed and stupid, blaming herself for running to the cats in the first place. She tries to howl, but finds it hard without her wolf vocal chords.
4. One of the fisher cats takes a feather off his head to reveal that he's actually a wolf, and has been this whole time. He tells Ersatzica his story about he thought he was a cat since he was a kid, and how he's grateful for all the kindness Ersatzica showed them while they were imprisoned, doing things to make them more comfortable. He tells her how people can do things out of the kindness of their heart, and not just because they were told to do so by an authoritarian. Ersatzica realizes what she's been trying to do all along is make life better for her people, not hurt them. The fisher cat also tells her the origin of the feather (it has to do with monassus).
5. Ersatzica flips the script and teaches the fisher cat how to howl, and that draws the attention of Mudrich. Ersatzica convinces her that she's real by reminding her how much she's done for her. Mudrich confesses that "new Ersie" hasn't done anything and has been a total jerk. Mudrich frees Ersatzica and the fisher cat.
6. Mudrich informs them that the wolf counter invasion is about to begin. Awoomoon finds the prison empty and sends Wryonin, Lemilay, New Ersie to find them. Ersie uses her cat skills to sneak around the wolf village, while Mudrich and fisher cat run interference. Wryonin has the boots. Eventually, Wryonin catches Ersatzica, and Ersatzica makes up with Wryonin, and he confesses that he missed her. Then they confront Lemilay, who is backed up by New Ersie. New Ersie has been kissing up to Lemilay, so Lemilay is not so quick to side with Ersatzica. After an ensuing argument that shows that New Ersie is able to be more loyal to wolf ideals than Ersatzica, Lemilay betrays that she's known all along that New Ersie is an imposter, "She's even a better you than you ever were! She's loyal and supportive, and does whatever I tell her." Lemilay also spills the beans that she's planning on Awoomoon dying today, and that she'll be chieftess soon. They fight, and they manage to get the wolfskin from New Ersie. Or maybe instead Lemilay acts shocked to find out New Ersie isn't a wolf and turns on her. They get the wolfskin either way. Awoomoon calls them to the front lines.
7. Ersatzica gets to work on a plan to stop the battle. She tweaks the boots to amplify sound instead of silencing it, and she modifies the drum to work on howls. She wears the wolf skin for the howling, which beats into the drum, which gets amplified by the boots. The battle ensues, Awoomoon is indirectly killing cats left and right, and lots of blood shed on both sides. Ersatzica gets there right as Mudrich is about to be slapped with a losing 1v1 duel. She plays the drum, gets everyone in sync, then stops playing. Everybody freezes in place, unable to move until the drum plays again. She tells everyone the truth, that Monassus and his cat friend were killed by accident, and that this whole conflict needs to stop.
8. New Ersie sneaks up behind her and smashes the drum, allowing everyone to move again. The cats gain the advantage, and Ersie and her siblings are cornered. Ersatzica howls loudly, getting everybody's attention. Then she takes off the wolfskin and orders everybody to stop again. The cat captain agrees to a truce if Ersatzica comes back to the cat kingdom with him. Awoomoon warns Ersatzica that if she does, she can't ever come back. Ersatzica reluctantly agrees to go so that her wolf tribe survives.
9. Ersatzica goes to the cat kingdom, and moves in with the fisher cat. She wasn't allowed to keep the wolfskin, the boots, or the drum. She's off to start a new adventure in the cat kingdom.
