## Combat Mechanics <a name="combat-mechanics"></a>

- **Mudrich / Mother**: High physical damage output, melee-focused, Heart Fire activates in intense emotional state  
- **Ersatzica (Drums)**: Can sync target movements, slow/freeze enemies, support allies’ coordination  
- **High One**: Can resurrect if killed by fire, commands berserk cats via Blood of Artyr, immune to conventional attacks  
- **Berserk Cats**: Ignore orders, attack whoever is closest or attacks first, increased durability and aggression  
- **Magical Interactions**: Certain items (Boots, Wolfskin, Tooth, Hammer) interact uniquely; environment and emotional states can trigger powers
