jens notes about battle ready count (ch7)

batle ready: age (no children), medical status (not pregnant, not injured, not srsly sick),

count of srsly medically comprosmised: need help getting evacuateda
the next-of-kin also "medically compromised" bc theyre busy helping the medically compormised person

battle ready female and male are expected to fight, designate some of them as evacuation specialist

how did you get these answrss? maybe take into consideration some things you didnt think about









boulder explanation: scouting for post thats going to be built




ersatzica cant finish outpost bc lemilay, has to fninish last minute, recruits mudrich and fisher to help
see muddys side: fun to building



lemilay has menial task assigned to her?

lemilay has to use weed for medicinal purposes due to strreeses from hindsight




lemilay reminds awwooomoon of the bad things of her youth,
mudrich reminds awoomoon of the good qualities of awoomoon's husband





"this is difficult for us, so it must be really difficult for them, because we're so much better for us"
but the wolves actually trap themselves

cats purpsoely lose battles to make the wolves have infalted sense of ability, to surpsie them something

maybe explsive on mountains to cause avalanche?

cats feign weakness to trick wolves?

lemilays outpost gets shorter during presentation bc of swamp ground

muddy evacuation route?

wolf village trapped in between mountains? single file line path to other villages



spiders have myths about how bad other animals are

muddy befriend spider in tunnel she found by digging into ground

spiders have poisons on hand?



ersatzica becomes wolf chief AND cat queen?

awoomoon tells lemilay she loves her in the heat of battle, and that she doesnt need to try so hard anymore

then lemilay has change of heart

lemilay becomes ersatzicas right hand wolf, so later they can go into history to learn about ss
