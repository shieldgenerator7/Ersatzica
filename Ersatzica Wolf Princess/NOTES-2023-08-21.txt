notes from earthshine about chapters 1-6:

too many adjectives

make narrator tone of voice more down-to-earth


introduce characters more slowly


play out moments:
-tragic cat death in prologue
-emotional moments: happy sad cute love heroics


focus on character and voice, character arc

play up the characters motivations in their dialogue, beliefs and values


clean up high concept, clean up outline, and structure
dig in deep, what are you trying to say?
--> theme


whats so compelling about the character that makes you want to write a story about them?



what exactly is she doing to the boots?
tinkers tend to be more creative, and less social

problem solver



relationships are more important than tradition

people's needs change over time




character that is ok with losing relationships to keep to tradition

what are the flaws of each? what are the advantages?


arc: fusion, rejection, ertake, 

does it become utopia if tradition is eliminated?
