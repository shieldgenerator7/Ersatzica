Ersatzica Story Beats
I'm writing this story about a cat named Ersatzica, who grew up believing she was a wolf. She was raised by wolves since birth, and was given a magical artefact called the Wolf Skin of Monassus as a young kitten that transforms its wearer into a wolf. This story is about Ersatzica and her discovery of her true cat self.

Plot
The cat and wolf factions are on the verge of having peace talks, but tensions are still high. One cat soldier hates wolves with a passion and won't let peace happen, and tries everything she can to sabotage it. Ersatzica discovers her true cat self and spends time with the rebel cat soldier, not realizing she's working against the peace talks by doing the "training exercises" the rebel cat has her do. Then in the climax, Ersatzica has to fess up that she was the cat that did some of those bad things so that the wolves don't back out of the peace talks. But in doing so, she labeled herself as a traitor, and had to admit to everyone that she was a cat.
Then again, I kind of want her to be able to choose to be a wolf at the end of the book. Or at least have that option. If she's labeled a traitor then I don't think she'd have any choice but to go live in the cat kingdom. I mean, I want her to go there eventually, but not in this book.
But I do want it to be revealed that she's a cat in this book, and have her deal with the fallout, and have to reconcile with her family.
Maybe she actually persuades Archleon that its better for both sides to have peace, so the very same two people who eroded the peace talks have to be the ones who ease the tension and show that cats and wolves can be friends. But then Ersatzica is revealed to be a cat, and their attempt fails. But while everyone is not fighting, Yosummit takes the opportunity to go up to Ersatzica and kiss her, thus proving the point that a car (Ersatzica) and wolf (Yosummit) can be friends. This could also prove as a moment of respect from the sibling that disowned Ersatzica for being a cat, thus mending their sibling bond.
Of course Ersatzica and Archleon would have to show that they're friends without admitting that they were the ones behind the chaos that eroded the peace talks. But then again, maybe they don't do all that much at all besides unveil the truth behind the past, especially about Pantrinome, Retriyoan, Quivester, and Monassus. Perhaps even Garoftle.
But if Ersatzica is of royal cat blood, wouldn't that be enough to persuade the cats into peace? There would also be the wolves to convince. And maybe because she's not really the leader of the army, she can't do it. But then she gets Pantrinome's drums, and she uses them to slow the pace of the battle down, to the point where no one can move until she hits the drum again.
