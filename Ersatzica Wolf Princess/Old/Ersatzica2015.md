“WHAT ARE WE?!”

“CATS!”

“AND WHO SHALL WIN?!”

“CATS!”

“CATS!”

“CATS!”

The battle cry of the clan leader screams back at her as the cat army cries out in glory. Tonight they will get their revenge. Tonight they shall have their glory. Tonight they shall defeat the wolf army and make them their unwilling slaves. Tonight they will conquer what’s left of the land that was once broken to chaos.

Pantrinome smiled smugly as she looked out at her troops and thought about the surprise attack she was going to make. The wolves had been better organized than she had thought, and it had taken a lot of time to wear them down to the point that a raid would have any chance of success. So tonight, she was going to apply a little gathered intelligence. It had only recently been discovered that the wolves were led by a high chief, and not democratically led as the cats had been led to believe. Knowing this meant everything, as she now knew where to strike.

“When we get to their village, you make a distraction,” she pointed to a cat across the table. “Aim to draw out the guards from the high chief’s tent. Then I will proceed to sneak into the tent and take out their leader.” She clenches her fist and observes it, as if she was imagining encaging the soul of her enemy.

Then it was dusk, and time to set the plan into action. The feline warriors moved swiftly and silently through the forest, making hardly a sound. Pantrinome, in particular, was wearing her grandmother’s boots of stealth, which prohibited her from making any sound. Not even the sound of the kittens kicking in her womb could be heard from outside.

Sneaking up behind perimeter guards, she and her taskforce slit the back of the wolves’ necks, paralyzing the guards from the waist down. Soon the lights of the wolf village could be seen. Pantrinome easily stealthed to the position next to the door. She gave a hand signal to a warrior sitting at the edge of the light. The warrior put on a wolf skin, stepped into the light, pretended to trip, fall down, and scream in pain.

Soon, a tall wolf came out of the chief’s hut, along with other guards in the area. Pantrinome then turned the corner and tiptoed down the short hallway to the chief’s room. Side stepping against the wall, she could only see a little of what was lying on the bed beneath the lit lantern. Soon, she could hear heavy breathing, and realized her foe was weak. Now was the time to strike.

“Roooaaarr!” she mouthed as her boots silenced her battle cries and steps forward. She lunged at the figure lying on the bed, holding her spear up in a perfect arc headed for the heart. Then she noticed something odd: there was more than one figure.

She stopped in her tracks, taking in what she saw on the bed. It was a new wolf mother feeding her newborns. The four newborns were all wrangling each other vying for a position. She rubbed her own belly, the pups a reminder of her current state. Then her eyes wandered to the mother’s head.

The mother wolf was neither sad nor scared. In fact, she seemed to be in a state of bliss, despite the recent intrusion. Instead, she stared into those deep green eyes of Pantrinome’s, quietly telling her how she’s proud of her babies and what she’s accomplished so far. But most of all, her eyes declared her love for them.

Pantrinome stared back, completely taken aback, both by the fact that the high chief’s wife was here instead of him, and by the look in her eyes. All of a sudden, she realized how wrong she had been, how driven she was that she would risk the lives of her unborn kittens to tackle a simple battle objective. Her look of hatred and drive melted away to a look of love and realization.

However, her moment of redemption was short-lived. A spear suddenly burst through her chest. Her silent grunt was further silenced by her grandmother’s boots. She dropped the spear to the floor. She dropped her body to her knees. She fell to the ground, bleeding. The spear laid snugly in her body like a thermometer in a meatloaf.

“Are you alright, my dear?”

“Yes, I am fine. So are the pups.”

“I’m never leaving your side again.”

“I love you, Feisty.”

“Raawr!” His reply was cut short by an enraged cat warrior charging down the hallway to introduce his head to the end of a spear tip.

“I’ll keep you safe, always.” He ripped the spear out of the dying feline and threw it into the heart of a now dead one. He marched up, grabbed it, and went out to engage the attacking cat warriors.

She laid there, feeding her pups, content amidst the death and war to just lay there with her pups. A clawed finger appeared on the edge of the bed. Then another, and then a whole paw. Then a second one. The top of the dying feline’s face overtook the top of the bed and she mouthed something to the feeding canine.

“Don’t worry, I will,” assured the canine, one mother to another.

The feline blinked her eyes slowly, then collapsed onto the floor without a sound.

Not long after, another figure ran through the hall to greet the scene in the bedroom.

“Oh my coons!” it was the nurse who had been sent to take care of the royal canine. “Are you alright, my highness?”

“I am, yes, however, we have an emergency on our paws.”

“Is one of your pups sick? Defective?”

“No, but this fallen warrior was pregnant.”

“Oh my coons! I’ll go get Clounch!”

“There isn’t time. There’s a knife on the wall. You’ll have to do it manually.”

“Oh my! No! Ahhheeew!” although she squealed about it, the nurse grabbed the knife and reluctantly cut a shallow slit in the husk’s lower abdomen. Inside were four slimy larvae writhing in pain. They seemed to be trying to make some sort of noise, but it was silent. Not even the knife cutting through the flesh made any sound.

“Oh, poor babies!”

“Hurry, bring them here, they won’t last much longer.”

“Oh-“ the nurse picked one up. “This one doesn’t seem to be breathing!”

“Give it here.”

The nurse handed it off to the wolf and she grabbed it in her mouth, and rubbed it with her paws.

“Oh, I don’t know anything about birthing felines!”

“Bring them here,” she repeated.

The nurse picked up an orange one that appeared to be breathing. The wolf mother gently grabbed it and pushed some of her own pups aside to make room for it.

“Good.”

The nurse picked up another one. “This one feels cold… ooh…”

“Here,” the wolf mother held out her hand.

The nurse gave it to her, along with the other one that looked cold. After handling them, she noticed small spots of blood on her hands. Her hands were already bloody from cutting open the womb, but these blood spots were new.

“Ahhh… ahh!” the nurse cried. “It’s the babies- it’s –it’s…”

“Shhhh…” shushed the mother.

The nurse ran out crying.

The wolf mother licked the wounds of the bleeding kittens, but it was too late. They had been slain with their mother. The one that had stopped breathing had also stopped moving. There was nothing she could do, so she licked it.

“May you rest in peace, Pantrinome.” She placed her hands over the dead kittens, keeping them warm. She laid there in relative silence, the only sound being the squeaks and squeals of the newborn pups and kitten.

Meanwhile, the battle raged on outside. The nurse returned and stayed by her side throughout, providing for the new mother as best she could. The fighting lasted all night. It wasn’t until dawn when she woke up that she noticed the fighting had stopped. The nurse got up to check on the surroundings for the wolf.

Dead cats and wolves littered the village, among them the high chief. The nurse returned with a rough body estimate, keeping the two counts separate. But she didn’t have the heart to tell her that her husband had been lost in the heat of battle.

Being clever doesn’t always pay off. Between his not returning and the nurse not responding, she figured it out on her own. A tear dripped from her slowly saddening face.

“Mam, think of the children.”

She looked at the newborns, stroked them, and sucked in her tears. She would stay strong for the young ones.

With the old leader gone, the new wolf mother was now the head of the pack. Although some thought she was crazy for adopting a kitten, they all respected her and obeyed her every command. However, no one really liked the odd pup out, whom the wolf leader had named Ersatzica, the lesser-qualified replacement for the late Pantrinome.

Ersatzica had been given the wolf skin that her kind had used that night to sneak in. However, they had found a way to more or less permanently attach it to her, so she couldn’t take it off and rejoin the feline empire. But despite her outward wolfness, all the wolves knew that deep down, she was a cat, a sworn enemy of the wolves. No one accepted her for who she was. No one, that is, except her canine brothers and sisters, who shared a common ignorance with her of her true feline nature.

“Ersie! Ersie!” her sisters woke her up from a mid-afternoon cat nap. “We’re going to Great Granfork’s cabin! Wanna come too?”

“What?” asked Ersie, rubbing her eyes sleepily.

“Oh, come on, sleepy head! We’re going to Great Granfork’s cabin!”

“Great Granfork’s cabin? Where’s that?”

“Somewhere far away from here! Mom says we’re finally old enough to go check it out!”

“Great Granfork’s cabin?” She blinked twice. “Great Granfork’s cabin!” she sprang up with surprising speed and pounced on her siblings. “I’ve been waiting to go ever since I was a pup! I can’t wait to go!”

“Well, we gotta hurry! Great Granfork’s son is leaving right now!”

And with that, Ersatzica burst out of the hut and ran down the trail to catch up with Yosummit, Great Granfork’s son. Her siblings caught up with her and playfully bit her tail when they had caught up with Yosummit.

Hearing the commotion, Yosummit turned around briefly. “We know there’s no girls allowed up there, right?”

“What?” Ersie stopped in her tracks, mouth full of wolf tail.

“That’s right,” smiled Yosummit slyly. “There’s no girls allowed in Great Granfork’s cabin.”

“But, mom said we could! She said we were finally old enough!”

“I know. This doesn’t contradict what I said.”

“How?”

“Think about it. You’ve reached a certain age, haven’t you?”

“Oh are you serious?!” exclaimed one of Ersie’s siblings. “I heard that certain species change gender when they age. Maybe that’s what he’s talking about? Is that what you’re talking about?”

Yosummit just chuckled softly.

“He’s chuckling, guys, that means he’s serious.”

“But that means that…”

“Yes, we become boys when we get up there!”

Yosummit chuckled audibly.

“But that means… that Yosummit started off as a female…”

“Actually…. um…” Yosummit stopped in his tracks. He put his finger up, as if to say something, then put it down. He continued walking.

“He didn’t say anything gals, that means it’s true!”

“Wow, I have always been a female wolf,” thought Ersie. “I can’t imagine what it’d be like to be anything else!”

“Same here!”

Once they got to Great Granfork’s cabin, Yosummit opened the door and walked in. The girls waited outside. Finally, Yosummit turned around.

“What are you waiting for?”

“You said there’s no girls in Great Granfork’s cabin.”

“You did?!” came an old angry voice from inside the cabin. A thigh bone flew through the air, and Yosummit blocked it with his hand.

“Ow,” cried Yosummit, shaking the pain off. “Granfork, I was just teasing.”

Granfork groaned and mocked Yosummit as he made his way to the door. “You’re welcome to come in, young ones.”

The girls poured into the cabin, looking with excitement at all the cool things on display along the walls.

“Now, young ones,” Granfork declared. “There shall be no touching of the heirlooms. They are for looking only.”

“Ooh, what’s this?”

“Don’t touch that!” yelled Granfork. “That’s Zayhard’s shard! It’ll cut anything made of flesh!”

“Are we made of flesh?” whispered one wolf girl to another.

“I thought we were made of fur.”

“Yes, you’re made of flesh!” snapped Granfork.

While her sisters kept Granfork busy, Ersatzica explored the halls, glancing at all the ancient objects stored precariously in the cabin. Finally, she found something that caught her eye. It was a pair of golden-plated boots, with red latches. They were placed on a shelf with a placard saying, *Retriyoan’s Boots, Boots of a Fallen Feline Warrior*. Ersatzica stared at the boots. Somehow, she felt a strange connection to them. Which was odd, since they belonged to a cat, and she was a wolf.

She put a hand out to touch them, then pulled it back. She reached again, and this time, she touched it. On the third try, she grabbed them. She felt a rush of energy that trickled coolly up her arm. Although it frightened her at first, she felt comforted by it.

Looking both ways down the hall, she grabbed the boots off the shelf. She pulled them close and hugged them. The surge of energy grew stronger, and this time it trickled directly to her heart. She could hear her heart beat louder now, and could even hear her own blood flow near her heart. She had never been so ecstatic. After a few squeezes, she had another great idea.

She slipped one on, and then the other. She closed the clasps on the boots, and suddenly the energy dispersed throughout her body and her hearing improved drastically.

“Wow, I can hear my own heartbeat,” she said. Or so she thought. She soon realized that no sound had actually escaped her mouth, even though it had come up and out her esophagus. “Whoa, these boots are awesome!”

“Ersatzica!” Great Granfork had finally found her. “What are you doing with those boots?”

Ersie froze. She stared rosy-cheeked at Granfork, then looked down at the boots. “They’re comfortable.” She moved her mouth, but no sound came out.

“Er-satz-ica, you should know better, young one!” Granfork waved a bone at her. “These heirlooms are very dangerous. You shouldn’t be touching them, let alone wearing... wearing…” He stopped talking.

“Granfork?” Ersie asked.

“How are you even wearing those? Only feline legs can fit comfortably into those boots!”

By this time, Yosummit and Ersie’s siblings had appeared.

Ersie looked at her black, wolf-like hands, and at her fur coat. Yep, she was still a wolf. So why was she comfortable wearing boots made for cats?

Suddenly, the boots unleashed an energy wave unlike the other one. This time, it felt like it was battling with the side of her that was wolf—that wanted to be wolf. Her legs changed size and contorted to match a new blueprint. Her hands changed form to become more felinine. Her long, canine claws folded and hid themselves. Her long, canine muzzle shortened and turned white. She was losing her wolfhood.

“Granfork! Granfork!” cried Ersatzica. But her cries were for not, as no one could hear her. And even if they could, there was nothing they could do. She would have found out sooner or later.

Soon her whole body was transformed, and what she thought had been her face, her scalp, and her ears, unveiled themselves to actually be a part of an old skin from a dead wolf. She grabbed it and threw it on the ground, letting out a squeal of disgust from having her face come off as if it had been a mask all along. Under the mask’s long black hair, her long, flowing red hair poured out, covering her shoulders with warmth like sunbeams. Her fur had turned orange and her solid color coat was now accented by white hands and a white underbelly. Her once beautifully black tail was now striped orange with an autumn-painted tip. Her transformation was complete. She had lost her wolfhood, and had stepped into cathood.

She screamed in agony. Had her whole life been a lie? Had she really been a cat all along?

However, these questions slipped her mind for a second when one of her siblings asked, “Is this what happens when you turn into a guy?”

“Now, calm down, Ersie,” her wolf mother embraced her from behind, gently stroking her autumn red hair.

“Mom! I’m a cat! I can’t possibly be a cat!” Ersie raised her arms and screamed at the top of her lungs. Her wolf mother could feel the vibrations of her lungs, but no sound came out.

“It’s going to be alright, Ersie,” she reassured. “Just calm down. I can’t hear anything you’re saying. Just calm down. It’s going to be alright.”

“But cats are our enemies! I can’t be a cat! I’m not an enemy!” Ersatzica reached down and frantically tried to undo the latches on the boots.

“It’s no use dear,” she continued stroking her hair. “Those boots are made to be worn in battle. Panicking only makes the latches tighter.”

“I’m not a cat, mom! I’m not a traitor! That’s not me!” Ersie crossed her arms and pouted.

“I know you have a lot of questions, Ersie. I’ll answer them as soon as you get out of those boots. And you’ll get out of those boots as soon as you calm down.”

KNOCK. KNOCK.

“Mam?” Yosummit peeked around the corner.

“What is it, Yosummit?” she asked sternly, clearly not pleased that her and Ersie’s privacy had been violated.

“Um, nevermind…” Yosummit blushed and closed the door.

“Don’t be upset, Ersie,” she cooed. “It’s all going to be alright in the end. Just relax, and let me straighten your beautiful hair.”

“I AM not!” came a voice from outside the room.

“Such a lovely day today, isn’t it?” her wolf mother clearly didn’t hear the voices outside the door.

Curious as to why she could hear them and her mother couldn’t, Ersie listened in.

“Yes, you are! You’re totally in love with her!”

“No, I’m not!”

“Yes, you are!”

“No, all I said was that I thought her red hair was beautiful! How does that in anyway imply…”

“Yes, it does! You know it does!”

“What, I’m not allowed to compliment a girl’s hair?”

“Admit it! You like her! You like cats!”

“Ouch! Don’t touch me there! It tickles!”

“I’m beautiful?” Ersatzica looked down at her paws. “How could anyone think I’m beautiful like this?” But with that one word, her outlook suddenly changed. Before where she saw treachery, she now saw her white socked hands. Where once she saw double-crossing, she now saw her furry orange feet. Where once she saw deceit, she now saw her red, silky hair. “So, I’m a cat?”

CLICK. CLICK.

“Ersie!” Her wolf mother squeed and gave her a big hug. “I missed you, Ersie! I’m glad to have you back, my little pup!”

Ersie twisted to meet her wolf mother eye-to-eye. “Mom, I’m a cat.”

“But you’ll always be my little pup!” she hugged her one more time. After giving her a good squeeze, she let go and looked her in the eye. “Right, you must have a lot of questions.”

Ersie repositioned herself to face her mother comfortably, and her wolf mother loosened the latches and removed the boots.

“How long have I been a cat?”

“Your whole life. You were born a cat.”

“Why did you make me believe I was a wolf?”

“I knew you wouldn’t be accepted into wolf society as a cat, so I gave you the wolfskin of Menoskus.” She nodded to the wolfskin that Ersatzica had discarded earlier. “It grants its non-wolf wearer the ability to become a wolf.”

“At will? If I concentrate enough, can I turn back?”

“No, dear. You must be wearing it for it to have an effect.”

“So, what about my real parents?”

“Dear, your real parents are dead.”

Ersie hung her head.

“They died in the fighting on the night that I found you. In fact, if I hadn’t been led to you, you would have not survived the night.”

“Why?” tears formed in Ersie’s eyes. “Why did you take me? Why didn’t you just let me die?”

“Ersie!” she leaned forward and gave her a big hug.

“I’m an enemy, mom! Why would you save me?”

“Ersie, dear, it’s alright. Just let it out.”

Ersie cried on her mother’s shoulder, fully audible from outside.

CREEEAAK.

“Is everything ok in here?”

“Go away, Yosummit,” scolded the wolf mother.

Ersie squeezed her mother tightly. “I don’t want to betray you, mom! I don’t want to be your enemy!”

“Shush, shush, Ersie. You don’t have to, and you don’t have to be.”

“But how am I going to live in the village? No one’s going to accept me!”

“Ersie, it’s going to be alright. It’s going to be alright, Ersie,” she reassured, stroking her hair.

“I know, mom,” Ersie said, as she squeezed tightly for a moment and then let go.

“Better now?”

Ersie nodded as she rubbed her eyes.

“Now, get up. There’s a lot we have to discuss.”

Ersie picked herself up and stood up.

“First, we must introduce you to your siblings.”

Ersie nodded.

“Yosummit!”

BAM!

“What is it? What’s wrong?” Yosummit stormed through the door and ran up to the two.

“I would like you to gather my other young pups and have them meet us at Dawn’s Shade at sunset.”

“Yes, mam!” Yosummit stood, resolute. Then, stealing a glance at Ersatzica, he added, “By the way, you look better as a cat.”

“Yosummit.”

Yosummit blushed. “Yes, mam!” With that, he ran off to get Ersatzica’s siblings.

“You’re kidding me, right?” asked one of Ersie’s brothers.

“No, she really did! Didn’t she?”

“Yes!” confirmed the other sister.

“What kind of trickery is this? Everyone knows wolves don’t just turn into cats!” he still wasn’t buying it.

“You’ll see when you see her.”

They had now reached Dawn’s Shade, a near-flat stone slab at the base of a cliff overlooking a sea view. The tree canopies shaded the majority of the slab, except for one spot that moved throughout the day as the sun did. It was a popular picnic spot for the wolves and several members of the village could be seen here at any one time. However, tonight the wolf mother had requested this spot be privately available to her and her family only. It was rare that she did this, but she felt it was important.

“Glad to see you all could make it.” she said, greeting her children.

“What’s this about, mom?” asked one of the male pups. “Ersie turning into a cat?”

“Let me just preface it with this: Things happen in this world that are not easily explained. When these things happen to others, it’s not all that hard to believe. But when it happens to you or your own, you can be blinded by your expectations of the truth. But the truth is, is that the truth never conforms to your idea of it.”

She grabbed him into a head hold and licked the top of his furry head. “So try to have an open mind, little pup.”

He pushed himself out of it. “This is some sick joke, mom.”

“Calm down, little pup. It’s no joke.”

“Yeah, calm down,” pitched in one of his sisters, biting his arm playfully. He bit her ear back.

“Ok, everyone, I would like to introduce you to…” she said, cueing Ersatzica to come out. “Mm-hmm! I would like to introduce you to…”

She stared at a crevice in the rock wall big enough for five people to hide in during a rain storm. “Ersatzica!” she demanded with a stomp.

Ersie turned the corner and smiled and waved.

“It’s a cat!” yelled the hard-headed brother. He charged her and pinned her against a wall. “What have you done to Ersatzica?!”

Ersatzica’s ears folded back and she gulped.

“Earling!” the wolf mother grabbed him and shoved him to the ground. “This *is* Ersatzica!”

“But it can’t be!”

“Hey, brother,” peeped Ersie shyly.

“Ersie?” he stared up at her from the ground. “It can’t…. can it? Is it really you?”

“It’s me,” she confirmed.

“Oh, Ersie! I’m so sorry!” he sprang to his feet and gave her a big hug. “I’m so sorry this happened to you.”

Ersie hugged him back just as tightly.

“Whatever did this to you, I promise that I’ll find it and stop it. We’ll get you back to normal, I promise.”

“Um, that’s the thing…” Ersie disengaged from the hug and looked away from her brother.

“What is? What’s wrong, Ersie?”

“Well, it’s that, um, you see…” Ersie couldn’t muster up the strength to tell him. “I’m… I’m…”

“Oh for howling out loud!” exclaimed the other brother. “She’s a cat! Can’t you see that?”

“What?”

“This isn’t some kind of spell or something, she’s been a cat all along!”

“No! That isn’t true. Is it, Ersie?”

Ersie looked away.

“Ersie?” his face turned pale. “Oh… my… coons… my sister’s been a cat all this time…” He dropped to the ground and leaned against the wall, holding his hands on his brains. “I can’t believe it… everything I’ve known is a lie…”

“Ersie!” exclaimed one of her sisters. She ran up and tackled her from the front, knocking her off balance. Amazingly, Ersie landed on all fours, with her sister underneath her, still holding on. Ersie picked herself up.

“Dog pile!” the other sister screamed before tackling Ersie from the back.

“Well, why not?” shrugged the other brother, hopping on.

The hard-headed brother got up and stormed off without a word.

Everyone else stopped what they were doing and watched him walk away.

“It seems it will take him a little longer to adjust,” observed the wolf mother.

One of the sisters unfroze and bit Ersie’s ear.

“Meowr!” she pushed her sister away with a quick paw shove.

Her sister came back and body bumped her. “Haha, Ersie, you make funny new noises now!”

“Haha, I do! Meow!” Ersie pawed her sister. “Meow! Meeeeeow! Meeooooow!”

“Oh! Ersie! There’s the moon! Can you still howl?” she sat down on all fours and turned her chin skyward. “HOOOOOOWWWWWOOOOOOO!”

“Let me see…” Ersie copied her sister’s position, one that she was very familiar with as a wolf. “MEEEEOOOOOOWW!”

“Heh,” let out the brother. “You ain’t no wolf, sister.” He pulled her in for a hug, and licked her furry neck. “But you’re still just that, our sister.”

Ersatzica and her siblings slept under the stars that night at Dawn’s Shade. The air was cool and the weather was just right for a sibling snuggle on the smooth rock surface. One by one they all drifted off to sleep.

The stars above Ersatzica faded from existence as the stars of her dream were emerging. They were greeting her with a bright cheer that the real ones lacked. She was sitting up and looking around. She was still at Dawn’s Shade, but now she was accompanied by cats. She had seen pictures of cats, and these ones didn’t seem to be like the ones she had seen. They looked like her wolf siblings, but contorted and recolored to look like cats. They were sitting in a circle around a fire, and Ersie was left to her lonesome. Yawning and stretching out, she was getting up and walking over to them. But the surface of the stone was expanding infinitely between her and her cat siblings. She kept on walking, even though she wasn’t getting any closer. The stars were smiling at her while she walked, but she wasn’t getting anywhere. Finally, her dream was wearing thin and she awoke.

She brushed a tail off her face and sat up, propping her body up on her elbows. Beyond the pile of wolves shone the light of a campfire. Its only occupant was a lone wolf. Ersatzica
