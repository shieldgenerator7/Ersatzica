Ersatzica
Prologue
https://youtu.be/OykiLWjpOzY 
Half past Moon Howl, the cat warriors stalked swiftly through the night. Their glowing green eyes streaked through the darkness. On their silent paws they skated through the forest, seeking their target. Their golden fur swayed in the wind. They carried nothing but their courage in their hearts and their spears in their hands. They filtered through the rough forest path until they came upon a steep hill. Their legs sprang them into the air and their claws grabbed onto the cliffside. One claw hand at a time they climbed up.
Their leader reached the top first. She leapt onto the plateau and peered with a deadly gaze. She surveyed the outpost, revealing the predictable locations of the enemy troops. She beat her drum twice, but it didn't make a sound.
Her clanmate received the message. He tiptoed behind a clueless wolf soldier. He brandished his knife and swiped it at the wolf's back.
The wolf's ears pricked and it turned around, blocking the attack and sending the knife flying. With one quick counter strike, the wolf slayed the cat soldier. The wolf plunged his sword into the cat carcass laying on the ground.
The wolf's head rose up to eye level as its tail swayed. Its gaze challenged anyone to try and ambush it again. It stared into the darkness and growled.
Suddenly, its gut was pierced from behind. It held its belly as it bled out. Its knees buckled, but something stopped it from falling. It looked up and behind at its killer.
The cat leader stood there in the moonlight. Her hair flowed in the wind, royal red and maroon. Her face was cast in shadow but her eyes still glowed a bright green. Just below her chest were two drums held up by a band. They were well worn on the top, but the golden trim showed no sign of age. A rolled up scroll hung tightly in the band. Her hands could be mistaken for furry white gloves and her arms for orange sleeves. Her big round belly could not hide its very muscular shape. Her tail floated high in the wind, orange striped and red tipped. Her paws were completely obscured by red gold-trimmed boots. They had an ornate mechanical quality to them, and although they were made of rigid materials, they made no sound when pounding the brick platform.
The wolf's eyes widened and its jaw fell agape. Its face paled and its limbs went weak. With one last breath, it let out a pitiful howl. The sound nonetheless carried throughout the outpost, calling out to its kin. A loud howl erupted from the outpost, warning of the wolf pack that was about to descend onto the cat warriors. 
The cat leader signaled to her comrades to advance into the outpost. But before they could get far, four wolves popped out of the woodwork and blocked their path. The cat leader holstered her spear and held her drums at the ready. She hit them several times, but they made no sound. Still, her soldiers got the message. They singled out the wolf on the left and defeated it easily. Now it was the wolves' turn. They struck back and injured quite a few of the felines. A wolf swung at the cat leader, and she just barely got her spear out in time to block. A second wolf appeared behind the first, pointing his sword at the cat leader. Blocking one sword with a spear was hard enough, but blocking two was inconceivable.
The second wolf swung his sword, and it hit its mark. The sword sliced through the torso of the first wolf. The sliced wolf let out a ghastly howl, and the cat leader lowered her spear. The second wolf pulled its face off to reveal that of a cat warrior. Its wolf body transformed instantly into an upright cat body. The disguised cat nodded at the cat leader, then put its wolf face back on, turning fully back into a wolf.
The rest of the wolves were easily cleaned up, but there were more on their way. The cat leader silently tapped her drums three times. Her fellow warriors assumed a battle stance and awaited the ambush of wolves so she could escape. She expertly stalked across the outpost, dodging left and right through the buildings and evading all the rushing wolves. She arrived at an official looking building, one of the few that still had its guards. With two quick strikes she slaughtered them in the throat. They gasped for breath, but no howl carried their spirits.
She stormed through the door and down the halls, taking out any and all guards along the way. She arrived at the most important room. Spear at the ready, she barged in. The room was a small chamber built up with brick and supported with thin log pillars. Moonlight beamed through the open ceiling and reflected off the walls. Across from the cat leader, a figure shrouded in shadow squirmed and writhed on a cot. The cat leader held up her spear as she approached the cot. Soon, she could hear heavy breathing, and realized her foe was weak. Now was the time to strike.
She pantomimed a roar and charged forward with silent footsteps. She lunged at the figure lying on the bed, holding her spear up in a perfect arc headed for the heart. Then she noticed something odd: there was more than one figure.
She stopped in her tracks. Her wide eyes darted back and forth at the moonlit scene. It was a new wolf mother feeding her newborns. The four newborns were all wrangling each other vying for a turn. The cat leader put her hand on her own belly. Lumps from inside her squirmed and rubbed against her hand. She turned her attention back to the wolf mother. The wolfess had a soft smile on her face, and her eyebrows were relaxed. She stared into those deep green eyes of the cat leader. 
https://youtu.be/git6DCXSqjE  
"Pantrinome," the wolf mother gently whispered, as if welcoming a friend. "Meet my babies." She took Pantrinome's hand and placed it on the first pup. "This is Wryonin. He's the first one." Pantrinome's claws sheathed as her hand was moved to the next pup. "This one's Lemilay. She's got this pretty birthmark on her forehead." The wolf mother rubbed a thumb lovingly over the second pup's head. Then she brushed some dirt off the third one. "This is Mudrich. I don't know how she manages to get so dirty." Pantrinome's muscles relaxed as her hand lay on the fourth pup. "Meet Ersatzica. She lets the other pups have so many turns, I'm worried she's going to get sick."
Pantrinome let her hand rest on Ersatzica, the fourth pup. Her fur was very soft and her heart very warm. It was like cuddling with siblings in a bed of humog leaves, like laying on a stone patio in the morning sun. Its heart beat like a little drum. BUM. BUM. BUM. Then with a little squeak, she woke up. She rolled over, and licked the hand blanketing her.
All of a sudden, the fuzzy warmth of the pup grew. It crawled up Pantrinome's arm and lodged itself in her heart. It overtook her chest in a big fireball of emotion, pushing out the mechanical drive to wage war. Her pulled back ears pricked forward, her furrowed eyebrows eased, and her downtrodden countenance turned up. An inexplicable euphoria filled her chest cavity. Ersatzica, the newborn pup, had melted her cold heart.
Pantrinome reached down for the wolf mother's hand, and placed it on her own pregnant belly. She looked into the wolf mother's eyes and smiled. The wolf mother closed her eyes. The kittens wriggled inside Pantrinome as the wolf mother held her hand there.
She looked up at the expecting cat mother. "I hope someday I can meet yours, too."
Pantrinome closed her eyes and took a deep breath.
"Take this! You howl-bereaving feline!" KACHINK! A sword burst through Pantrinome's lower chest. SCHIK! Its blood-tipped blade dripped as it retreated.
Pantrinome held her neck and mimed choking, but did not make any noise. She released her spear. It hit the floor, klink klink. She dropped to her knees. She fell to the ground, bleeding. 
"Awoomoon!" The wolf chief sheathed his bloody sword and knelt next to the cot. "Are you alright, my dear?"
"Yes, I am fine. So are the pups."
"I'm never leaving your side again." He grasped Awoomoon's hand in his.
"I love you, Feisty." Awoomoon ran a hand through his thick head fur.
"Raawr!" An enraged cat warrior cut the reunion short. It charged down the hallway to introduce a wolf to the end of its spear tip. The cat hurled the spear at Feisty with deadly accuracy.
"I'll keep you safe, always." Feisty ripped his moonstone-hilted sword out of its sheath and deflected the incoming spear. He marched up, shanked the cat warrior, and charged out to engage the other attacking cat warriors.
Awoomoon laid there, feeding her pups, content amidst the death and war to just be in the moment with her newborns. But she wasn't alone. A clawed finger appeared on the edge of the bed. Then another, and then a whole paw. Then a second one. Finally, the top of the dying feline leader's face overtook the top of the bed. She mouthed something to the feeding wolf mother.
"Don't worry, Pantrinome, I will," assured Awoomoon, one mother to another.
Pantrinome blinked her green eyes slowly, then collapsed onto the floor without a sound. Her hands fell neatly onto the drums around her chest.
Not long after, another figure ran through the hall to greet the scene in the bedroom.
"Oh my coons!" cried the midwife. "Are you alright, my highness?"
"I am, yes, however, we have an emergency on our paws."
"Is one of your pups sick? Defective?"
"No, but this fallen warrior is pregnant."
"Oh my coons! I'll go get Clounch!"
"There isn't time. Use your knife. You'll have to do it manually."
"Oh my! No! Ahhheeew!" the midwife squealed. Nonetheless, she grabbed her knife and reluctantly cut a shallow slit in the feline husk's lower abdomen. Inside, four slimy larvae writhed in pain. They seemed to be trying to make some sort of noise, but it was silent. Not even the knife cutting through the flesh made any sound.
"Oh, poor babies!" The midwife reached in and fished for a kitten.
"Hurry, bring them here, they won't last much longer."
"Oh-" the midwife found one and pulled it out. "This one doesn't seem to be breathing!"
"Give it here."
The midwife handed it to Awoomoon, who grabbed it in her mouth, and rubbed it with her paws.
"Oh, I don't know anything about birthing felines!" The midwife pulled out another one. "But the prognosis is not good. This one's cold!"
"Bring it here," Awoomoon repeated. She took the cold kitten and held it to her chest.
"Ahhh... ooo... Things are looking dire." The midwife pulled out another one, covered in blood.
"Here," Awoomoon held out her hand. Despite the midwife's gentle touch, the kitten landed with a squishy squirt of blood. Awoomoon tore a piece off her cot sheet and wrapped it around the kitten.
"How are they doing?" The midwife turned away from the bloody mess on the floor and addressed Awoomoon.
"Where's the fourth one?"
"I only found three."
"There's a fourth one in there. Find it."
"Ahhh... ooo..." The midwife tiptoed back to the body and plunged her hand into the bloody pot again. She swished her hand around, squirming as it scraped the edges.
"Where is it?"
"It's not in here."
"We're running out of time."
"Ahhh... ooo..." She dug around. Suddenly her eyes widened. "There's a hole! There's a hole!" The midwife punched her hand through the hole. A small current blew under the carcass and cooled the wet blood on her hands. Her eyes widened. "We've got to move the body!" She pushed and pushed, but the body was too heavy. She went to unstrap the drums but Pantrinome's hands were resting on them. So she unclasped the boots first.
Bum. Bum. Bum. 
The midwife pulled the boots off one by one. She pushed the cat body over on its side with a great effort and a big breath. Underneath where the body had been, laying in a pool of blood, covered in a blanket of guts, was the fourth kitten.
Bum. Bum. Bum.
The midwife reached in and extracted a kitten burrito from the messy pile. "It's breathing!"
Bum. Bum. Bum.
"It's still warm!"
Bum. Bum. Bum.
"It's not bleeding!"
Bum. Bum. Bum.
Awoomoon held out her hand and received her kitten. "Hello, little one." She licked it. "Here you are." She gently pushed some of her own pups aside and laid the kitten down in the new spot. "There you go."
Bum. Bum. Bum.
The midwife's heart raced. She knelt there on the ground, staring into the cot. Finally her breathing normalized. "How are they fairing?"
"They're going to need some help." Awoomoon looked over the critical kittens.
"I'll go get help!" The midwife ran off.
Awoomoon licked the wounds of the dying kittens, but it was too late. The breathless one deflated and stopped moving. The cold one didn't warm up. The bleeding one leaked out, soaking its bandage and the cot in blood. They had been slain with their mother. There was nothing she could do, so she licked them.
She licked the suffocated kitten. "Awooo!"
She licked the frozen kitten. "Awooo!"
She licked the shanked kitten. "Awooo!"
She held the dead kittens in her hand, and lifted them up to the moon. Gazing up into the shining moon, she thought of her former nemesis. "May you rest in peace, Pantrinome." 
Awoomoon looked over her newborn pups and kitten. She stroked each one, smiling as they each responded with a little squirm. Then a tear fell from her eye.
"Awooo!"
Chapter 1
https://youtu.be/LPtw1KvEq6M 
"Awooo wooo woo! Ah ah!" whistled a sturdy, muscular wolf. He picked up a log, set it on a stump, and raised his axe above his head. The axe came down and split the log in half with a satisfying KACHIP. "Awooo wooo woo! Ah ah woo!" He picked up another log. KACHIP!
Snap. A twig snapped behind him.
"Awooo wooo ah! Wooo ah woo!" Not missing a beat, he-- KACHIP --split another log in half.
Snap. Another twig, also behind him, but this time closer.
"Woo ah woo! Ah woo woo woo!" KACHIP! "Ah woo woo!" KACHIP! "Woo ah woo!" KACHIP! "Ahwoo... ah wait a minute!" He stopped cutting wood. He put his wolf nose up into the air and sniffed. He sniffed top left and top right. He glared up into the sky for a moment. Then he shrugged and lifted his axe again. KACHIP!
Snap.
"RAWR!" Suddenly black furry arms grappled around his neck and black furry legs wrapped around his belly, forcing him to drop the axe. "Guess who?"
"ARGH!" He screamed. "Ersatzica! Is that you?"
"You got me! Did I scare you, Yosummit?" Ersatzica hopped off his back, jostling her white chest fur. 
Yosummit brushed himself off before saying, "Uh, no."
"Come on, you know I did!" Ersatzica rubbed her black-furred wolf head against his shoulders. Her black ears folded against his thick bones.
"Um, no, you didn't, Ersie." Yosummit looked up at the sky and made a goofy smile.
"Come on...!" Ersie rubbed her shoulder blades against his arm.
"Not in the least bit." Yosummit looked away and folded his arms in a big, exaggerated breath of air.
"Come on... you screamed." Ersie rubbed her torso against his side. "That means I scared you."
"No, but do you know what that actually means?" His eyebrows furrowed and his arms shifted.
"No?" Ersie's tail rubbed his waist. Then her eyes widened. "No! Not that!"
"Yes, I'm afraid so!" Yosummit turned around and picked her up in one swift motion. "Raspberries!" He shoved his face into her stomach fur and blew. APHU! APHUUU! APHU-U!
"No! No! No!" Ersie giggled, squirming in a futile attempt to free herself. "Haha! No! No more!"
"Ok, but one last one." APHUU-UUU-U-UUUU! With that done, Yosummit set Ersie down.
"That last one was abnormally long!" Ersie complained.
"I had to get you back somehow, right?"
Ersie just eyed him.
"Also, Ersie, remember what I said?"
"Oh, about not surprising you while you're working with dangerous tools?"
"Yeah." Yosummit raised an eyebrow.
"Sorry." Ersie held her head down. "I heard whistling and I thought it was an all-clear." She looked up at Yosummit.
"Ok, I forgive you." Yosummit took a hand and mopped Ersie's head fur.
She opened her jaw and playfully bit his hand.
"Nar nar nar! You rascally pup!" Yosummit wrestled his hand free and scratched the white fur under Ersie's chin. "So what is it you wanted to show me?"
Ersatzica looked left and right. "What makes you think I wanted to show you something?"
Yosummit rolled his eyes. "Come on, you always want to show me something."
Ersie's arms scrunched up in front of her, her ears shot straight up, and she bounced up and down. "Oh! It's so exciting! I can't wait to show you!"
"Ok, then... show me."
"I can't. It's not finished yet. But I need some help."
"Okay, what do you need?" Yosummit folded his arms.
"Just a few things, maybe like... 15 logs that are all 4 tails long." Ersatzica handed him a rolled scroll.
"15? Whew!" Yosummit looked at the "schematics" for the logs. His tail shot straight up. "What are you building, a castle?"
"It's a secret. But I promise you'll love it!" Ersie squeezed her arms under her chin. "Please? Please? Please?"
Yosummit took a big breath and sighed. "Ok, Ersie. I'll get you these supplies. But I have to work on my quota for today first."
"Oh thank you thank you thank you!" Ersie jumped onto Yosummit for a hug.
Yosummit hugged her back and squeezed.
"Uh!" Ersie gasped.
Yosummit put her down.
"Thanks Yosa!" Ersie ran off.
"No problem Ersie!" Yosummit called out.

Ersatzica ran swiftly through the valley forest path. Sunlight glistened through the leaves of the treetops, giving her wild stripes as she ran. On her silent paws she skated through the forest. She stopped to take deep breaths every so often, then continued running. Soon, she saw a white wolf covered in mud spots ahead. She came up from behind and tackle-hugged her.
"Ersie!" The wolf exclaimed, nearly dropping the basket in her hands.
"Mudrich!" Ersatzica rubbed her head against Mudrich's. She noticed the basket in her hands. "You got the fibers!"
"I sure did!" Mudrich stuck her muddy muzzle down into the basket and produced an assortment of plant fiber strips. "Did you get the logs?"
"Not yet, but soon." Ersie unhugged and walked alongside Mudrich. "In the meantime, we can work with the scraps from my last project."
Mudrich giggled as she nudged Ersatzica. "So, did you tell him?"
"Tell him?" Ersie gasped. "And ruin the surprise?" They continued walking down the trail.
"Wow, Ersie!" Mudrich exclaimed. "You actually kept a secret! That's not like you."
"I know, strange, right? But he -- this device -- just means so much to me -- will to him." Ersie licked her hand and stroked the top of her head. "I just really want to surprise him." She blushed.
"Did he guess what it is yet?"
"No, he has no clue. It's going to be a complete surprise."
Ersatzica and Mudrich arrived at a clearing surrounded by trees. A hammock hung in one corner. The other corners were littered with materials, tools, and past projects. The only visible paths out were the one they entered through and another one that headed in the direction of the sound of a rushing river.
Mudrich set her basket down on a wooden work table. "I can't wait to see the look on his face!"
"Yeah me neither!" Ersatzica pulled plant fiber strips from the basket and tied them into knots. "He's going to be so excited!"
"Even more excited than when you made him that boat!"
"And even more excited than when I made him that folding chair!"
"And and even more excited than when you made him that umbrella!"
A leaf crunched behind them.
"Did you hear that?" Ersatzica turned one ear.
"Hear what?" replied Mudrich absentmindedly.
Another leaf crunched.
"You don't think it's a cat do you?"
"Why would there be a cat warrior all the way out here?" Mudrich weaved some plants into a bow.
Ersatzica turned around. "Lemilay! It's you!"
Behind them stood a silver and white wolf with brown seams. A bald patch lay in her forehead about where one would place a crown. Her chest floof nearly doubled her thickness, even in the summertime. She stood elegantly on her hind legs as if someone were about to take a picture of her. Her tail swayed casually behind her. Her hands rest clasped together at her front, gingerly holding a rolled scroll.
"I thought I might find you two here." Lemilay approached graciously, almost gliding across the uneven dirt floor of the clearing. She looked at Ersatzica and Mudrich. "I'd hug you, but you're a little dirty right now."
"It's fine, I don't want to hug Your Poofiness either." Mudrich kept working on her task.
"Well too bad Lemlem!" Ersatzica jumped into her sister's arms, making her drop her scroll. She rubbed her face against Lemilay's head.
Lemilay pushed her back. "Ew. Ersie, please! Not when you're so dirty." Lemilay graciously squatted to pick up her scroll.
"It's just dust, Lem." Ersie dusted herself off. "See? It comes right off."
"Okay... " Lemilay frowned and furrowed her eyebrows. "Anyway, I came by because I need help with my speech."
"So you've actually decided to visit Cat Country?"
"No, it's just an outpost I'm visiting. But yes, I have accepted the offer. And I need to have my speech ready." Lemilay cleared her throat and held up the opened scroll. "Cats and wolves, thank you for joining me here today. It is a huge honor for me to be here to talk to you all. On behalf of all wolves, I would like to extend my hand in kinship to the cats. Perhaps you can accept our offer to come together to make a peace agreement. Let us end this 50 year war between us." Lemilay put down the scroll. "So, what do you think?"
"Your... voice is... um, good." stuttered Mudrich.
"Your voice is beautiful, Lemilay." Ersatzica said.
"Thank you, thank you." Lemilay bowed. "I only have a week to prepare and practice this speech."
"Well, good luck." Mudrich threw another bow onto the pile.
A torrent of leaf crunches approached them. Before they could comment on it, a dark grey wolf with a white belly had already appeared at the entrance.
"Oh, good, you're all here. Mother has summoned us all." he said.
"What for?" Mudrich continued making bows out of plant fibers. She meticulously placed one behind her ear.
"I don't know for sure. Come on!" He disappeared behind some trees.
Ersatzica looked at Mudrich and Lemilay. They all shrugged.
"Wryonin! Wait up!"
They ran to the entrance, and there was Wryonin, waiting for them. "Come on, hurry up!" He ran ahead of them a little. "Come on, slow pokes!"
"Are you crazy? I'm not running in all this dirt! It'll get everywhere!" Lemilay scoffed.
Ersatzica looked at Mudrich. Mudrich smirked back. "First to the Drum Tree wins the puddle cake!" Ersatzica took off running. She went so fast that she even passed Wryonin, who was taken by surprise. Mudrich took off too but was a tad late on the start.
"Hey you didn't start the countdown!" Wryonin complained. He took off in a full-on sprint and had little trouble catching up to and overtaking Ersatzica.
"Catch you by surprise, did I?" Ersatzica teased.
"Uh, no." Wryonin slowed down so he could hear Ersatzica. "I was just giving you a head start."
"Thanks, but I don't think I need it--" Ersatzica stopped and bent over, panting heavily.
"You okay there, sis?" Wryonin came back and slung Ersatzica over his shoulders.
"Yeah," Ersatzica wheezed. "Just a little out of breath."
"Small lungs?"
"Small lungs." Ersie's arms hung lazily over Wryonin's back.
"Well it looks like I'll win!" Mudrich sprinted past and touched the Drum Tree. "I win!" She smiled and wagged her tail.
"You got me, Muddy!" Ersatzica admitted. She looked at the back of Wryonin's head. "I shouldn't have challenged her to a race that far away."
Wryonin set Ersie down next to the tree. "Plop goes the sissy." He patted her on the head.
"Thanks, Wry." Ersie sat cross-legged on the ground and leaned up against the tree.
BUM. BUM. BUM.
"Ah, Drum Tree, you never disappoint." Ersie closed her eyes and smiled.
BUM. BUM. BUM.
The Drum Tree was one of the ends of the circle. Logs of other trees were laid out in a circle around a small fire pit. Opposite the tree, just outside the circle, stood a wash basin and slicing table. The Drum Tree was very tall and shaded the whole circle from the sun, allowing only small beams to peek through. Ersie felt most at home when sitting up against the Drum Tree.
BUM. BUM. BUM.
Mudrich sat down next to Ersie and poked her. "You owe me your next puddle cake."
Ersie rolled her eyes. "Ugh, I guess I do."
"Whew! Double puds for the Muds!" Mudrich pumped her fist in the air.
"Speaking of mud," Lemilay finally caught up to them. "You should clean up. Mother isn't going to be happy to see you all dirty."
"Ugh! Why did I get cursed with the hard-to-clean coat?" Mudrich unenthusiastically got up and dunked her hands in the wash basin. "If I had your fur, Lemilay, no one would know it's dirty." Mudrich splashed water on a mud spot that was covering up a patch of her all-white fur.
"Hey, I clean my fur too, you know!" But Lemilay still self-consciously re-examined her dark fur for any dirt.
Mother finally arrived. "Good afternoon, my pups." She stepped one foot after the other into the Drum Tree circle. "Mudrich, nice to see you taking a bath. Lemilay, I want to hear that speech of yours. Ersatzica, I hope you've made time to fix my bed. Wryonin, thank you for fetching them."
"Anything else I can do, Mother?" Wryonin bowed briefly.
"Not right now, sit down." Mother sat on the log bench at the head of the circle. "I have something very important to tell you, my pups. As you know, Lemilay will be traveling to a cat outpost next week. Despite both sides showing signs of peace, individuals may still seek conflict. Be on the lookout for any stray cats near camp. If you see any, do not engage. Even if you win the fight, reports of wolf brutality could ruin any chance we have at peace talks with the cats. Avoid cats at all costs. Are we clear?"
Ersatzica, Mudrich, Lemilay, and Wryonin all nodded their heads and mumbled in affirmation.
"I said, are we clear?" Mother stomped her foot.
They all said, "Yes, Mother."
"Very good. Now, I have matters to attend to." She got up and kissed Wryonin on the head. "I love you, Wryonin." She kissed Lemilay on the head. "I love you, Lemilay."
"Mother, when will the bricks--" Mudrich asked.
"Hush. Ask Wryonin." She kissed Mudrich on the head. "I love you, Mudrich." Then she came to Ersatzica, who was leaning against the Drum Tree. She kissed her on the head. "And I love you, Ersatzica." She strode towards the exit. "See you tomorrow, my pups." Then she was gone.
"So, Wryonin," Mudrich turned to him. "When are the bricks arriving?"
"Uh, I don't know. I'll have to ask Mother." Wryonin poked a stick at the ground.
"Figures," grumbled Mudrich. "We never get to spend any time with Mother anymore."
"Hey, at least we have this time." Wryonin drew a stick wolf in the dirt. "Mother doesn't make time for a private meeting with many wolves, you know."
"Still, I miss when we were pups. We would spend all day with her." Mudrich laid back in the dirt.
"That was a long time ago, Muddy." Lemilay read over her speech again. "A lot has changed since then. We've changed since then."
"You know what I miss most?" Mudrich sat up and looked around at her siblings.
Ersatzica leaned over and bit her ear. "Rough housing?"
Mudrich glanced at her black-and-white sister. "Ersie..." She eyed her sister and growled.
"RAWR!" Ersie pounced on Mudrich, knocking her onto the ground. She bit her neck and tried to pin her hands.
But Mudrich pushed her up and rolled her over. "Ersie!" Mudrich rolled them both over so she was on top. "You're going down!" She swiped at her, but she blocked. They rolled over again, this time trampling over Wryonin's dirt drawings.
"Guys!" Wryonin pulled his stick out of the tussle area and tried redrawing his dirt masterpiece. But the tumbling sisters knocked the stick out of his hands. "This means war!" He threw the stick away, flexed, and jumped into the dogpile. Scratches, punches, and bites were all used in this fight. They kicked up a lot of dust.
COUGH COUGH. Lemilay looked up from her speech. "Guys, this is immature. We're grown up now. We shouldn't be doing this."
They all stopped fighting and looked at her. Then they looked at each other. Finally, Wryonin made the battle cry, "Get her!" The three wolves jumped on their speech-writing sibling and tackled her to the ground. Lemilay screamed but fought back. She pulled her leg back and kicked one of them off her.
Ersatzica bit her ear. "Surrender!"
"Never!" Lemilay protested.
"Surrender or I taste your ear!" Ersie threw her head back and forth.
"I will not!" Lemilay tried tickling Ersie, but she didn't let go.
"I'm tasting your ear!" Ersie declared.
"Only cats taste ears!" Lemilay leaned over and kicked Ersie in the stomach.
"Blegh, ok!" Ersie let go. "That's a dirty move, Lemlem."
"Well it's not my fault cats taste ears."
Wryonin stood up. He offered his hand out to Lemilay, who gladly took it to get off the ground.
"Oh my. My coat is so dirty!" Lemilay fake cried.
"Don't worry," Mudrich dusted herself off. "It's just dirt. It's really easy to clean."
"Maybe for you," Lemilay pouted. "But my chest floof is so thick it makes cleaning very difficult." She reached up to ungunk her ear. "And we have Ersie over here being a total cat."
"Hey, I'm not a cat."
"Then don't act like it."
"Well look at us, all dirty!" Wryonin stated. "I think we all need a..." he let his voice trail off.
"A bath." Lemilay finished.
"River bath!" Mudrich exclaimed. "Beat you there!" Mudrich took off towards the river. "You all owe me another puddle cake!"
"Hey!" Ersie shouted as she took off. "I want my puddlecake back!"
Wryonin and Lemilay ran after Mudrich and jumped in the river together. They splashed each other in the face and splashed back. They swam. They played water games. 
"Ah, I feel so clean now!" Lemilay was the first to get out. She shook and splattered her river-wading siblings with water droplets. She turned around, saw the look on Mudrich's face, and scrambled to get away from the water's edge. "Oh no, not today, Muddy!"
"Oh Lemlem!" Mudrich called as she climbed out of the river with soaking wet fur. "Want a shower?"
"Not that kind of shower!" Lemilay squealed as she ran.
Wryonin looked up at the sky as he got out of the river. "Looks like the other kind of shower is on its way." He shook himself dry. "We should probably head back to town."
"Or..." Ersatzica hopped down from the tree she was in. "We could go to Dawn's Shade."
"I don't know, Ersie." Wryonin picked up a stick. "Mother is expecting us back before dusk."
"Come on, she's not going to notice." Ersatzica rubbed her furry head against her brother's shoulder.
"Yes she will." Wryonin nibbled a piece of the stick off.
"But it's been a long time since she kissed us goodnight." 
"Yeah, but she said she'd make an effort for us, and we have to be there in case she does come." Wryonin peeled the bark off the stick.
"But what are the chances she would come tonight, of all nights?" Ersie rubbed her shoulder against his side. "Besides, it's not like Dawn's Shade is off limits."
"Hmm..." Wryonin looked away.
"What's all this about Dawn's Shade?" Mudrich returned.
"Dawn's Shade? That's where Great Granfork will be tonight." Lemilay said softly.
"How do you know that?" Wryonin let a hint of excitement slip.
"It's that time of cycle." Lemilay pointed to the darkening sky where the moon would be. "When it's almost Moon Howl he always goes to Dawn's Shade."
"So when the moon is almost full Great Granfork always goes to the same place?" Wryonin twiddled the stick in his hand.
"As consistently as flowers blossom in spring." Lemilay nodded.
"So...?" Ersatzica smiled at Wryonin. Mudrich joined her.
Lemilay shrugged. "Why not?"
Wryonin sighed. "Ok, let's all go to Dawn's Shade."
"Field trip!" Mudrich rejoiced.
It had started to sprinkle by the time they reached Dawn's Shade, a rock formation with many features. It had steep rocky cliffs that led down into the river below. A rocky path had been carved out that led from the forest floor down to the cave landing, and another short path had been made to go from the landing down to the river. Its most well known feature is its rocky outcropping that sticks up so high it reaches out of the tree tops. 
"Let's go up there and howl at the moooon!" exclaimed Mudrich.
"We can't." Wryonin led them to the rocky path that led to the landing. "It's about to rain and the moon isn't out."
"Aw, no fun," whimpered Mudrich. "We could have imagined it was out."
"Yes, but could we have imagined being dry?" Wryonin held out a hand. A couple of rain drops fell on it.
A raindrop hit Mudrich on the head right above her eye. "Yes?"
They all climbed down the irregular steps and crossed the landing into the cave. The cave was tall enough to make a small giant comfortable but was very shallow. Just inside the entrance, small stone boulders were seated in a circle around a pile of ash and twigs. The floor was tilted ever so slightly so that water would drain out towards the landing and down the path to the river, making those stairs very slippery.
Ersatzica poked her head out of the cave and looked around. "Where's Great Granfork? Is he not coming?"
"Great Granfork is very consistent," reassured Lemilay. "He always comes, rain or shine."
The rain drops fell more frequently.
"Well it looks like it's not going to be shine." Ersatzica came in and sat down on a stone seat.
"Well let's make some then." Wryonin grabbed two rocks from the ground and struck them together. Sparks flew out, but the twigs in the ash pile didn't ignite. "Mudrich, could you go collect more twigs?"
"But it's raining."
"Well just pretend it's not, right?" Wryonin smirked.
Mudrich whimpered. "Ok." She stood up, tail between her legs.
Ersatzica explored into one of the deep dark corners of the cave. "Hey wait, Muddy, I'm coming too! And look what I found!" Ersatzica reached into the void and pulled out a stick with some leaves attached to it.
"Isn't that the umbrella you made for Yosummit?"
"Yeah! Luckily he left it here. I'll keep you dry." Ersatzica held it up in the rain, and all the raindrops splished and splashed on the umbrella. Many mini waterfalls dripped down from the edges.
Mudrich hugged Ersie and she wagged her tail.
Mudrich and Ersatzica went back up to the forest to collect twigs. Mudrich gave a lot of them to Ersie, who held them with one arm while she held onto the umbrella with the other.
Suddenly, someone gasped. Ersatzica's ears pricked and she turned around. "Did you hear that?"
"Hear what?" Mudrich picked up another twig. When she reached up to put it in Ersie's arm, she was gone. "Ersie! Wait up!" Rain pelted Mudrich's face. She ran and caught up to Ersie.
"It's coming from this direction." Ersie led them to the base of the Dawn's Shade peak. 
"Ohhhh..." a voice moaned.
Ersie found the source of the voice lying on the ground. She knelt down. "Great Granfork? Is that you?"
"Ersie, my darling, I'm so glad to see you." The old brown wolf mumbled in the dark. "I've dropped my instruments and I can't seem to find them."
Ersatzica helped him to his feet. "Don't worry about them, Mudrich will find them." Ersie looked at her sister.
"Ugh, yeah, I'll find them."
"Oh, thank you, my dear. You are so kind, Mudrich."
"I'll see you back at the cave." Ersie held Great Granfork close as they walked away.
"Ok, see you there." Mudrich dropped to the ground and felt around in the mud for the old wolf's things. Rain pelted her fur.
"I'm so glad you two arrived. I don't know what I'd do if I had lost my instruments." Great Granfork recomposed himself and gave Ersatzica her arm back. Ersie straightened the umbrella.
They carefully stepped down the precarious stones that led to the landing. Great Granfork slipped and almost went off the edge, but Ersatzica held out the umbrella. Great Granfork grabbed it and Ersie pulled him back. They made it down to the landing the rest of the way without incident.
"Great Granfork!" Lemilay and Wryonin stood up and wagged their tails. "Awooo!"
"Awooo to you too, my younglings." Great Granfork steadily approached a stone seat and sat down. "Lemilay, hello." He nodded in her direction. "What brings you pups here on such an excellent night for scientific experimentation?"
"We actually came to see you." Ersatzica sat down next to him.
"Ah, you're here for one of my magical trinkets." Great Granfork reached into his coat. He pulled his hand out, but there was nothing in it. "But it's a really stormy night. And we have a campfire. This occasion is better suited for..." He put his pointer fingers in his mouth and pulled back the skin, bearing his sharp canine teeth. "...a ghost story." A low growl echoed through the cave.
Wryonin started shaking. So did Lemilay and Ersatzica.
"Half past Moon Howl, the cat ranger stalked its prey. But his prey was not just any. Oh no, his prey was thieves. Thieves who would dare to rob passing caravans in the woods as they traveled at night. They would sabotage the carriages and steal all the treasure and marketable goods. They made trade to and from the cats next to impossible. So the cat ranger took it upon himself to protect the wayfaring merchants. His name was Quivester. He dedicated his life to pursuing his noble aim. But he was not as honorable as he claimed."
Ersatzica, Wryonin, and Lemilay stared intently at Great Granfork.
"One day he saw a pack of wolves and mistook them for thieves. He drew his bow and arrow and killed the whole pack. All but one remained. He took the surviving wolf as his prisoner. This prisoner's name was Monassus. Monassus was a clever young wolf. He followed his cat captor for several days, biding his time. Finally he found an opening, and escaped the clutches of Quivester. He almost made it back to his clan."
The young wolves were on the edges of their seats.
"But then, it was getting dark. It was getting stormy. It was getting... rainy. Monassus lost his way in the dark. There was a flash of lightning. Monassus saw a figure in the distance. It had a triangle hat with a feather attached. It had a rather slim build. It had a long, short-haired tail. It had... glowing green eyes. Monassus scrambled to get away, but by the next lightning flash, he could see that his hunter was already upon him. 'You have taken something of mine.' The cat ranger pointed to an arrow lodged in Monassus' leg. He ripped it out. Then he stabbed him again with the same arrow, right in the throat! Poor Monassus didn't even get a chance to howl!" 
Ersatzica, Lemilay, and Wryonin lurched back in shock.
"Then in the smothering darkness, Quivester skinned the unlucky wolf and donned his skin. He became indistinguishable from a wolf, to the point that even a natural wolf wouldn't be able to tell he was a cat. He would use his wolf camouflage to lure stray wolves in with the scent of a familiar friend, and then slaughter them. The wolves he killed were never smelled from again."
The sky flashed bright and a low thunder rumbled.
"Some say, that on nights like tonight, when it storms and it rains, Quivester is still out there, hunting wolves and claiming their skins."
Ersatzica shivered and scooted closer to the fire. Wryonin rubbed his hands together before displaying them to the fire. Lemilay simply pinned her ears back.
"Awoooo!" A loud, scared howl rang out.
They all looked at each other. No one here in the cave had done it.
Wryonin's eyes widened. "Ersie, where's Mudrich?"
"Oh! Mudrich!" Ersie grabbed the umbrella and raced out of the cave. They all got up and followed behind her. When they reached the forest, they responded. "Awooo!" They waited.
"Awoooo!"
They rushed to the sound of the howl. When they got there, they found Mudrich laying in the mud face down. She was panting very heavily.
Ersatzica held the umbrella over her head. "Mudrich, are you alright?"
"Ersie!" Mudrich huffed between words. "Ersie!"
Wryonin knelt down next to her and examined her body. "Mudrich, where are you hurt?" He rubbed his hand through her fur, trying to find any sign of a wound. "Your heart rate is extremely fast."
"Choked." Mudrich let out between labored breaths.
Wryonin checked her neck. The fur was noticeably more compressed, even for being wet. He felt around her throat area. "I don't sense any damage. I think you're going to live, Mudrich."
"Legs..." Mudrich moaned.
Wryonin checked her legs. An arrow protruded out of her lower left leg. "Ooh. That doesn't look... Mudrich, I love you, sis. You're going to be alright. I'll fix you up."
Ersie lifted her up and hugged her. "What happened, Muddy?"
Mudrich hugged Ersie back but didn't stop breathing to speak.
"It's ok, Mudrich, let's get you home." Wryonin pulled her out of Ersie's embrace and slung her over his shoulder. He ran home reasonably fast for carrying extra body weight. Ersatzica and Lemilay followed close. Ersatzica had to stop to catch her breath only once or twice. When they got home, they put Mudrich in a bed and put a blanket on her. Wryonin and Clounch pulled the arrow out and tended to her leg wounds.
She had finally settled down enough to speak. "I couldn't tell who it was. It was too dark. But it definitely had a triangle hat and green eyes. I thought it was you, Ersie. But then it attacked me."
Wryonin looked at Ersatzica, who looked back at him. Wryonin looked at Lemilay, who also looked back at him. Sweat dripped down Wryonin's brow. "It couldn't be. He's been dead for years. Right?"
"Couldn't be who?" Mudrich asked. Before she could receive an answer, she dozed off.





Chapter 2
"Wryonin!" An angry female wolf stormed into the bedroom. "What is the meaning of this?" She looked down at her children gathered around Mudrich, who was lying in her bed with a cast. She growled.
"Mother!" Wryonin hung his head low and whimpered. "I... I... we, uh," he stammered.
"Look at me when I'm talking to you!" Mother stomped her foot.
Wryonin looked up, but still had trouble looking into her eyes. "We went to Dawn's Shade, and..."
"You went to Dawn's Shade? Even though you were supposed to come straight home before it got dark?"
"Yes, but we weren't--"
"Weren't what? Weren't thinking?" She shoved her face into his and stared. "Weren't thinking of the consequences of disregarding the rules? You could have all died out there tonight! Why?! Why did you go out there?!"
"We thought it would be fun to--"
"Fun?! You disobeyed safety rules for fun?!" She leaned so far into his face that she was pushing him back.
"Mother, it was my idea--" Ersatzica spoke up.
Mother looked up and barked. "Stay out of this Ersatzica! Go fix my bed, like I've told you a dozen times by now." 
Ersatzica huddled on the floor, burying her face in her arms, legs, and tail.
Mother returned her attention to Wryonin. "Trying to get your sisters to cover for you?"
"No, no, I take full respons--" Wryonin collapsed to the floor.
"Well don't you forget, young wolf." She stuck her pointer finger in his face. "You are the eldest among your siblings. As such, it is your duty, and your duty alone, to protect them. By the moon, I swear if you ever endanger my pups again, I'll have you banished so far that the cats won't even be able to reach you. Do you understand?"
Wryonin tried to speak, but found his throat clogged up with hidden tears. "Y-y-y--"
"I said, do you understand?"
Wryonin gulped. "Yes, Mam."
"Good." Mother shoved her face into his one last time before getting up and turning around. "See you tomorrow." Before exiting the room, she paused to speak. "And by the way, none of you are to leave this room tonight." She left without another word.
The room was silent. No one said anything. Mudrich snored. Lemilay leaned in a corner, staring at the floor. Wryonin was frozen in his awkward sitting position, too choked up to speak. Ersatzica sobbed into her fluffy wolf tail.
Mudrich snored in an odd pattern and took a deep breath. She sat up all of a sudden. "Oh my coons, guys! I just had the craziest dream!" She looked down at her leg. "Oh crap. It wasn't a dream." She looked up at Lemilay, then down at Ersatzica, and then at Wryonin. "Oh." She sat up and tossed her pillow at Lemilay. "Lemilay..."
Lemilay swatted the pillow to the floor. "I'm not in the mood." Her tail swished.
"Aw..." Mudrich swung her legs off the bed and onto the floor. The cast on her left leg hit Ersie in the back of the neck. "Ersie..."
Ersie didn't respond.
Mudrich playfully bumped her cast into Ersie's head over and over again. "Ersie..."
Ersie scooched over so Mudrich's leg could pass.
Mudrich let her feet dangle off the side of the bed. She lifted her arms up into the air and prepared to slam them onto the bed she was sitting on. "Wryonin!"
"Don't get up, Mudrich." Wryonin didn't turn to face her. "You need time to recover. Get back into bed."
Mudrich let her arms fall limp. She hesitantly pulled her legs back up and laid back down. "Wryonin, it's not your fault."
"Yes it is. I led us to Dawn's Shade. I ignored the rainstorm. I didn't scout for enemies."
"No, Wryonin," Ersatzica pulled herself together just long enough to talk. "It's my fault. I suggested it."
"And I supported it." Lemilay offered.
"I pushed you into going, too," Mudrich confessed.
"Yeah, but you guys aren't responsible. I am. I should have never let us go." Wryonin let himself collapse onto the floor, limbs sprawled.
"We would have gone even if you hadn't let us go." Ersatzica poked her head out.
"That may be so, but it was still my fault. I forced Mudrich to go out and pick up sticks." Wryonin sighed.
"But it was me who told her to gather Great Granfork's things." Ersatzica rested her head on her arms.
"Guys!" Mudrich interrupted. "I'm fine! We don't have to worry about whose fault it is. We're all alive. That's all that matters, right?"
Wryonin whimpered in agreement.
"Look, I'm going to heal up, get out of this cast, and then everything will go back to normal, just like it always does."
Ersatzica buried her head and cried a river. Wryonin turned over on his side and stifled his tears. Lemilay slid down the wall and sat on the floor.
"What? Is something wrong?" Mudrich looked around at her distraught siblings.
"We... we had to..." Wryonin couldn't get the words out.
"Had to what?" Mudrich looked at her cast but didn't notice anything strange about it.
"We had to amputate your leg, Muds." Lemilay said solemnly.
"OH MY COONS!" Mudrich yelled, feeling for her foot at the end of her leg. But it wasn't there. The cast started just below her knee and ended just above where her ankle would be. "It's gone!"
Ersatzica jumped into Mudrich's arms and squeezed. "I'm so sorry Mudrich!" Ersatzica cried into her sister's shoulders.
Mudrich pushed her back so she could see her face. "I'm just kidding Ersie! It's fiiiiine. It'll grow back in a couple of weeks. That's all."
Ersatzica pulled her back in for a hug.
"That's... that's not how that works." Wryonin corrected.
"You'll never race again!" Ersatzica sobbed. "You'll never get to claim my puddle cakes ever again!"
"It's ok, Ersie." Mudrich comforted. "I'll steal your puddle cakes some other way."
"You're never going to get your leg back, Muddy."  Wryonin sobbed.
"Well, then I'll just have to get a new leg."
Ersie stopped crying. "A new leg? That could work!" Ersie climbed off the bed and scrounged through Mudrich's belongings. "Where are your writing supplies?"
"Over there." Mudrich pointed with her cast to a pile of wet clay.
"This'll do." Ersatzica pulled a lump of clay off the pile and plopped onto the bed next to Mudrich's cast.
"Ersie, what are you doing?" Wryonin walked on his knees to the edge of the bed. 
Ersatzica molded the clay into a peg leg with a bulbous end.
"You know that Clounch will draw up specifications and Yosummit will carve the wooden peg leg, right?" Wryonin poked the bulbous end of the peg leg.
Ersie swatted his hand away. "Yeah, but that's not the kind of leg to run in. What we need here is a leg that can go just as fast as Mudrich can." She pushed the clay at the end upwards into a semi-foot shape.
Mudrich jumped in place. "You mean it's actually going to have joints?"
"Uh-huh!" Ersie extended the foot and added the rough shape of the toes.
"Oh! I've always wanted a bionic limb!" She shook her cast around. "Finally some part of me I won't have to clean all the time!"
"Weeell..." Ersie etched out the toes, using Mudrich's other foot as a reference. "Mechanical parts always function best when void of dirt."
Mudrich whimpered. She flopped her upper half onto the bed. "At least I'll have full control of it."
"Will you?" Ersatzica put her hand to her mouth, licked it, and rubbed it on her head. "How would that work? How would you do that?"
"I believe in you, Ersie. You'll figure it out." Mudrich smiled at the clay leg Ersie made. It only loosely resembled her other leg.
"Ersie." Lemilay stood up and leaned over the bed. "I think I know something that can help."

The next day, Lemilay led Ersatzica up to Great Granfork's cabin. Its entrance was a suspiciously wooden door on the side of a rocky mountain.
"Before you enter," Lemilay put her hand on the door and faced Ersatzica. "You have to promise me that you will not tell anyone about this place."
"I promise." Ersatzica put her hand on the door.
"And you have to promise not to take anything without prior approval." Lemilay put a hand up in front of Ersatzica.
"I promise."
"Ok." Lemilay pushed open the door. It creaked like old pine. "This place is huge. Stick with me so you don't get lost." She stepped into the room just beyond the door. "Oh, and one more thing." Lemilay turned around and plucked a strand of fur straight out of Ersatzica's chest.
"Ouch!" Ersatzica flinched. "What was that for?"
Lemilay wrapped the strand in a small lump of clay and placed it in a rectangular bucket above the door. "Welcome to Great Granfork's Cabin, officially."
Ersatzica stepped into the building. This "cabin" was less like a cabin and more like a museum. The room just inside the door was a lobby, and the room opposite the door was a sleeping and eating room. On the left and right were hallways that connected at an angle. On a map, the hallways formed a right angle and the lobby was the point where the two segments met. Ersatzica looked down one hall and then the other. Each hall was lined with clear spheres on the ceiling and with waist-high shelves on either wall. One wall had windows stretching through it, letting in natural light from outside. Ersie peeked her head out the door, but couldn't see the windows from the outside.
"Come, this way." Lemilay tiptoed into the left hallway. The hallway stretched far beyond the light of the finite windows.
"This hallway is really long." Ersatzica followed closely.
"You don't know the half of it." Lemilay pointed at several different plaques on the shelves and whispered to herself. "No, no, not this one... That? No."
Ersie followed along, looking at each individual item that Lemilay pointed at. They all looked like they were from a pretty old time period, but were in pristine condition. The metal items had no rust and the wooden items had no rot. The items were all of different types and materials. One item, of a certain type and material, caught Ersatzica's eyes in particular.
"What's this?" Ersatzica looked up at the wall where a painting was framed.
It was a painting of a cat, the only one in the entire hallway so far. The cat had neatly tied red hair and was covered in orange fur. Its green eyes jumped straight out of the painting. It held a spear in its white-gloved hand and a frown on its face. The painting stopped at the waist, but the cat's red-tipped tail poked up from the bottom edge. "Retriyoan," read Ersatzica. She looked down at the item below the portrait. It was a pair of golden boots. They had maroon trimmings and majestic mechanical mechanisms around the ankle and near the base.
She blew some dust off their plaque. "Retriyoan's Boots. These are the boots of Retriyoan, said to grant the wearer complete auditory stealth." Ersatzica looked up at the boots and stretched out a hand to touch them.
"Ersie!" Lemilay shouted from down the hall. "No touching! Remember?"
Ersatzica stood straight up and looked at Lemilay. "I'm not."
Lemilay glared. "Anyway, come here. I found it!" Lemilay motioned for Ersatzica to come.
Ersatzica ran, but was only slightly out of breath when she reached Lemilay. "What is it?"
"Garoftle's Hammer." Lemilay pointed to a plaque on a shelf and pulled a box out of the slot. She handed the box to Ersie, and then placed her hand on top of it. "This is Garoftle's Hammer. It can weld any two things together. It hasn't been tested on wolves yet, but it works wonders on raw materials."
"Eee! This will work so well! Mudrich will be able to have a fully functional leg!" Ersie lifted the top off the box and looked inside. She frowned and her ears drooped. "It's empty!"
"Empty?" Lemilay took the box and looked inside. She looked on and under the shelf. "Where'd it go?" She speed walked to the lobby. She pulled out a book from a cabinet and flipped through to a bookmarked page.
"What's that?" Ersie poked her head over Lemilay's shoulder.
"Not good." Lemilay placed her finger under an entry in a table. "It says here that Garoftle's Hammer was checked out by Great Granfork... yesterday."
"But yesterday was when he fell and Mudrich was attacked."
"Yes. Whoever attacked Mudrich yesterday must have stolen the hammer too." Lemilay closed the book and put it away.
"So was it Quivester or Quivester's ghost?"
"I'm not sure. Monassus died over 100 years ago. Quivester's body was never found, but it is improbable that he would still be alive." Lemilay led Ersatzica out of the cabin. "But whoever it is, they have the hammer."
"Well let's track them!"
Lemilay and Ersatzica went back to where they first found Mudrich. Lemilay put her nose in the air and then, reluctantly, on the ground. She sniffed around, then stood back up, dusting herself off.
"So?" Ersatzica looked at Lemilay.
"The rain's washed the scent away." Lemilay frowned. "But there is another way." Lemilay clasped her hands together and stood in a beam of light that shot through the treetops. She closed her eyes and bowed her head. The sunlight struck her bald spot and bounced back into the air, illuminating the dust above her in a cone shape. One would be forgiven for thinking a glowing unicorn horn was growing out of her skull. The dust flittered and glittered in Lemilay's horn. She calmly breathed in, and then breathed out.
Then she shivered. She shook and the horn flickered in and out. She held her head up, but her eyes were still closed. She moved her head as if she was watching something, but nothing was there.
"Lemilay?" Ersatzica waved a hand in front of her sister's face.
Lemilay didn't register it. Instead, she focused on a point in the distance. Her pupils moved around behind her eyelids. With a short jump, she took off in the direction she was looking.
"Lemilay! Wait up!" Ersatzica took off after her.
Lemilay led Ersatzica through the woods, dashing gracefully between the trees, despite her closed eyes. She ran to a river, dove in like a seagull, swam across like a dog, and popped out like a dolphin onto the opposite bank.
Ersatzica had to grab a nearby canoe. Lemilay was gone by the time she got across, but she could see her trail through the thick brush.
After about a mile into the woods, Ersatzica finally caught up to Lemilay. She stood behind a bush, peeking out over the edge. She moved her head left and right, as if tracking something.
"Lemilay?" Ersatzica laid a hand on her shoulder.
Lemilay shivered and collapsed onto the ground. She opened her eyes. "Ersatzica?"
"I'm here." She held out a hand.
Lemilay took her hand. "She's here." Lemilay pointed through some thin tree branches at a strange tent.
It was definitely built by a cat. Although the campfire was on the ground, the tent was up in a tree. It was more of a tarp laid over some branches, with enough material hanging down to act as walls. They weren't close enough to see if it had a floor.
"Ok, let's go." Ersatzica got on all fours and crept toward the campsite.
Lemilay pulled her tail and drew her back. "Are you crazy?" She whispered. "Mother said not to engage cats."
"There's no one here."
Lemilay pointed to a corner of the tent. A swinging rope hung out of it. But the rope was black and swung regularly as if propelled by an invisible force. Also it had lots of short hairs on it.
"Oh, it's a tail!" Ersatzica backed up.
"Well, we found the culprit. Let's let someone else handle this cat. I don't want to upset Mother again." Lemilay turned around and snook away until she was further away. Ersatzica followed.
[2020-07-29 TODO: EXPAND] 
When back at the outpost, they informed Mother about the location of the stolen heirloom. She then assured them that she would send out a retrieval party after the negotiations had been completed. Ersatzica didn't like this. She decided it needed to be done now, and that she could do it, even if no one else accompanied her. She rowed across the river and followed their previous trail to the cat's tent.
Ersatzica pulled back the leaves of the bush in front of her. Through the leaves she saw the tree tent and the campfire. She looked around, but didn't see the culprit. She got down on all fours and crawled around the bush to the campsite. SNAP. She stepped on a twig. 
The tent flap moved and out popped its occupant. It was a cat. She had black fur and a white underbelly. She had patches of brown on her back. She had a scar on her neck. She had green eyes. And she wore a triangle hat. She scowled at the trees as she turned her head.
Ersatzica darted behind another bush before the cat could see her. She watched the cat from behind the bush. The cat looked around for a bit, then went back into her tent. Ersatzica turned around and ran away. She didn't look back once but the hairs on her neck stood on end. She tripped once but quickly got back on her feet. Once she reached the river, she climbed in the boat she left and paddled to the other side. She pulled the boat ashore and up the bank that led to her workstation. Once there, she huddled in a corner and caught her breath. She breathed in and out rapidly in quick short breaths.
Mudrich snored in the hammock in the opposite corner. Once Ersatzica caught her breath, she ran over to the hammock and shook Mudrich awake. "Mudrich! Mudrich! Wake up!"
Mudrich rolled over and dropped out of the hammock. "Oww..." She grabbed her left leg.
"Sorry, Muddy," Ersatzica pulled her out from under the hammock. "But I have something important to tell you."
"What?" Mudrich moaned.
"I found Quivester's ghost!"
Mudrich's eyes opened wide. "You did?"
"Yeah, but I don't think it was Quivester. It was a cat wearing his hat."
"Either way, that cat is scary!" Mudrich's eyebrows furrowed. "Ersie! You could have gotten yourself hurt!"
"Yeah, but Muddy," Ersie hugged her. "She has Great Granfork's instruments! I have to get them back from her somehow. But she could hear me rustling in the bush, even when I try to be as quiet as possible."
"That's too bad." Mudrich yawned. "If only you could walk without making any noise. That'd be swell." Mudrich climbed into the hammock. "Now, if you could not make any noise for now, that'd be great." Mudrich dozed right off to sleep.
"Walk without making noise..." Ersatzica repeated. "Muddy! You're a genius!" Then she took off toward Great Granfork's cabin.
Once she arrived, after stopping for a breath once or twice, she entered and called out, "Great Granfork! Great Granfork!" 
No one responded.
"Great Granfork?" Ersie entered the museum-shaped cabin. She looked left and then looked right. "Lemilay?" Ersatzica shrugged. "I guess they're not here." She walked down the hall on the left and found the heirloom she was looking for. "Retriyoan's Boots." She read the label on the display. "These are the boots of Retriyoan, said to grant the wearer complete auditory stealth."
Ersatzica reached out to them. An aura of power greeted her hand. She pushed a finger through and touched the boots. An electric spark jolted up her arm. She pulled back. She looked at her arm. It was uninjured. She cautiously reached out again, this time grabbing the boots by the mouths. The boots let themselves be lifted, but without some gravitational resistance. They landed on the floor with a hefty thud.
"So you can make me walk without making a sound, right?" She sat down on the floor and put one paw in a boot. She put her other paw in the other boot. Her toes went halfway through past the soles and her feet stuck out too far. She got up and walked around anyway.
CLANK. CLANK.
"You clank a lot. And you're not all that comfortable."
"Well, they're not supposed to be." A soft voice entered the room. Without making a sound, the soft brown paws of a certain wolf entered Ersatzica's sight lines. "At least not for wolves."
"Lemilay!" Ersatzica's eyes widened. "I'm, uh, this isn't what you think it is."
"Please tell me that you weren't just trying to walk out of here wearing boots made for cats?" Lemilay stepped closer and peered down at Ersatzica.
"Well, yes, but not for the reasons you think I am." Ersatzica reached down to pull the boot off of her paw.
But Lemilay put her hand on the boot to stop her. "I thought I told you that these heirlooms are for display only?"
"You did, but I needed them."
Lemilay raised an eyebrow and frowned.
"You know that cat tent we found?"
"What about it?"
"Well I saw the culprit. But she's a cat, and could hear me coming from a mile away. I need these boots to be able to sneak up on her."
Lemilay sighed. "Sister, I know you mean well," Lemilay sat down next to Ersie. "But I don't need to tell you this is a bad idea, right? You can't expect to fit your wolf legs into those cat-shaped boots."
"But that hammer could help heal Mudrich. I have to try."
Lemilay stood up. "I see." She closed her eyes. "But I don't. I don't see you taking things off the shelf. And I don't see you putting them on." She walked away. "And I don't see you walking off with them." She stopped walking. "Are we clear?"
"I'm not here!" Ersatzica obliged.
Lemilay paused. "By the way," she stated, without turning around. "Those boots only work when properly strapped in." Then she finally walked away.
Ersatzica scrambled to get the boots clasped. She pushed and pushed, but the boots wouldn't clasp around her very wolf-like legs. Finally, she got frustrated. "I wish I had cat legs!" She huffed. She took a moment to rest and think about the situation.
But she didn't have long to think. Something strange was happening to her. Her nose was getting wrinkly and her muzzle was losing its pitch-black color. Her facial skin was being torn from her muscles, as if something was pulling it off. Her ears twinged and tickled as something furry pushed up from underneath them. A mask protruded from her face and overlaid her sight. She peaked out of the two eyeholes of what used to be her wolf snout. A layer of fur grew out underneath the skin that she once knew to be hers.
She panted. She breathed in and out rapidly and uncontrollably. "What is happening to me?" She pulled the mask off and looked at it. It was her wolf face, but in mask form. "What in the coons?!" She instinctively tossed it aside, but it flopped down right next to her. It was still attached.
Her hands were the next to change. Like sticking her arm out of the shade and into the light, her right hand faded from black fur to white fur. Her right arm faded from black into orange fur. The orange fur crept up her arm and overtook her chest. A flap of skin popped off her chest and underneath it the orange fur appeared. The same happened to her left arm. Then the skin on her back peeled off and new fur grew in. Now the mask of her old face laid on the floor next to her, completely separated. She kicked it away. It slid down the hall on the wood floor.
In all the commotion, she didn't even realize that her legs had also changed. The boots now fit her and she was very comfortable in them. She looked down at the boots. Then at her wolf skin. Then at the boots. "Wow, these boots really are magical!" She clasped the boots shut.
Her ears popped. Her new cat ears tingled. The sounds of the area poured in. Birds chirped, chipmunks skittered, and the trees whistled in the wind. "Where are these sounds coming from?" Is what she would have said out loud. But although her mouth moved, no sound came out. Ersatzica jumped up and fist pumped. She mouthed out the words, "It works!" Then she lost her balance and fell down on her bum.
She took some time to analyze her new feline body. Her white hands were shorter and had no claws at the end. She swiped with them and suddenly another segment to her finger appeared, complete with claws. Her eyes widened. She could bring her claws in, and take her claws out. They were retractable! She played around with her new retractable claws, bringing them out and retracting them back in. Finally she decided on keeping them retracted.
She looked up and down her arms at the orange fur that now coated them. The white fur on her hand extended further down her left arm than it did on her right arm. The orange on her arm had stripes of a darker orange color. The orange went all the way up to her chest, where it morphed into familiar white chest fur, but with a strange new texture. Her head had something hanging off it. She ran her finger through it. It was like fur, but longer. She pulled one of them, and then immediately grimaced and rubbed her head where the long strand of fur was attached. Strands and strands of the long fur swung in front of her face, tickling her nose as they swung by. Speaking of which, her muzzle was much shorter now.
She crouched forward and stood up slowly with the support of her arms. She put her hand against the wall to help balance as she stood up. She wobbled a little, then stood up straight and steadied herself. Then she took a step. She fell forward, but caught herself. Regaining her balance, she took another step. Then another. And another. She finally let go of the wall and took several steps without it. A little awkward, but she didn't fall. Then she wagged her tail and fell flat on her face. Her tail landed on her forehead.
She sat up and grabbed her tail. It was no longer a fluffy black wolf tail. Now it was an orange-striped short-haired tail with a red tip. It looked like a furry rope. It was much longer than her wolf tail, and would require getting used to. She wagged it around like she would her wolf tail, but it seemed to require more energy to do so. She let it hang from her waist as she stood up again. She spun around, spectating its movements. It moved up and down in time with her spins. It flew past the painting of Retriyoan.
Ersatzica looked at her hands, and that of the painted cat's. They were the same. She looked at her fur and that of the cat's. They were the same. And she looked at the tip of her tail, and held it up to the painting. They were the same.
"You... you..." Ersatzica mouthed. "You didn't just stealth me. You turned me into her!" Ersatzica bowed at the cat. "It's an honor to be in your shoes, lady."
She walked up and down the hall several times. Nothing made any noise, not even the floorboards creaked. Finally she took a deep breath and walked out of the cabin with focused eyes. Then she ran back in to retrieve her wolf skin.
She ran to her workshop, stopping to take a deep breath once or twice. Once there, she stashed her wolf skin in a slot carved into the stone wall that separates her workshop from the river embankment. She stood over Mudrich, who was still sleeping in the hammock. "Don't worry, Muddy, this will all be over soon." She mouthed the words, but no sound came out. She touched her feline hand to Mudrich's head and stroked her head fur.
Mudrich rolled over and snored.
Ersatzica patted her head, then trotted off in her new boots and her new body towards the river. She crossed in the boat again. She ran through the forest. Despite brushing against trees and bushes and snapping several twigs and crunching several leaves, her footsteps and movements didn't make the slightest sound.
She approached the scar-necked cat's camp. There appeared to be motion in the tent. She sneaked around, looking for what she came for. The items she moved didn't make a sound when she lifted them up or put them down. She didn't find the hammer. She looked at the tent. She squinted and tilted her head, but then shook her head. She picked up the frying pan in the middle of the fire and snuck behind the tent's tree. Once she was securely behind it, she threw the pan as far as she could in the opposite direction.
The tent squirmed and out popped its occupant. It was the same scar-necked cat that Ersie had seen earlier. She leapt out, bow and arrow drawn, and perched on the branch. She scanned the landscape for foes. Then she jumped down and made her way to the pan. She stared down at it and then looked around for the perpetrator.
Ersie moved quickly. She climbed up the tree, slipped into the tent, grabbed everything she could, and slipped out, all without making a sound.
Silent as she was, she wasn't lucky. The scar-necked cat turned around and saw her on her way out of the tree. "Hey!" she screamed with a raspy voice. She drew her bow and shot an arrow at Ersie's leg with deadly accuracy.
Ersie felt it all. The arrow hit her lower leg about where Mudrich had been hit. It came as a shock to Ersie, but it made no sound when it hit. It bounced off Retriyoan's Boots and landed in the grass. Ersie breathed in a sigh of relief as she continued to run with the items in her hands. Another arrow hit her, but this time in her long, flowing, red hair. It whizzed right through, cutting a few strands, but overall doing no damage.
"Get back here!" The raspy voice called out in a rage. The scar-necked cat ran after Ersie. Her footsteps pounded the ground, and they were getting closer.
It wasn't long before Ersie needed to stop to catch her breath. She stopped for a short while -- just long enough to take one deep breath -- before taking off again. But the footsteps were right behind her, and her extra long tail was yanked from behind. Ersatzica lost her balance and fell forward, dropping all the things she was holding.
"You traitor! I'll kill you!" The scar-necked cat brandished an arrow and held it like a dagger.
Ersatzica held up her hands and her tail to defend herself. The red tip of her tail rustled in the wind.
"Oh, uh, um," the scar-necked cat stammered. Her eyebrows loosened and her scowl turned into a dropped jaw. She dropped the arrow. "Your highness. I'm sorry. I didn't know it was you."
Ersatzica looked up from her huddled state. She let down her guard, letting her hands drop to her side.
"Please, I didn't realize it was you." the feline got down on her knees and put her fists together, shaking them as she looked up into Ersatzica's eyes from below. "Please have mercy. I was only doing what I thought was right."
Ersatzica smiled and patted her head. She stood up and pointed down at the instruments she had dropped.
"Uh, yes, your highness." The cat bowed and picked up the items.
Ersatzica held her hand out, and received the items, every single one.
"Thank you, your highness."
Ersatzica pointed towards the feline's tent.
"Yes, right away your highness. Farewell." And with that, the scar-necked feline left Ersatzica to herself.
Ersatzica leisurely walked to the boat. She rowed to the other side of the river, and parked the boat. She put the items on her workbench. She looked up and around. Mudrich was still sound asleep on the hammock. There didn't seem to be any sign of anyone else. 
Ersatzica pulled the wolf skin off the shelf. She stared into its eyeless face and admired its markings. Then she looked down at her current feline body: its orange stripes, short fur, long red hair, red-tipped tail, sensitive ears, and retractable claws. She sighed. She hugged the wolf skin. 
She draped the mask part over her head. The mask attached itself to her muzzle. Her nose stretched forward to fill out the space of the mask. Her teeth grew big and sharp. Her ears folded down, covered by the mask. New ears gained feelings in their place. The black and white coloring that she knew all her life dripped down from her head down to the rest of her body. The black fur grew out over her arm, like she was pulling her arm back into the shade of a tree. Her white chest fur and all its fluff returned. The wolfness crept down her belly.
As it returned to her waist, she remembered the boots. She frantically sat down and unclasped the boots. She got the boots off just before her feet changed back. 
"Phew!" She said aloud. "That was a close one!" She put the boots on the shelf and covered them with leaves. 

That night, a black and white wolf climbed the slope up Dawn's Shade to its peak. At the top, she knelt on her knees and looked up at the sky. The moon was a sliver away from full, and the clouds had all disappeared. The moon shone brightly onto the wolf at the peek of Dawn's Shade.
She stared into the moon and howled. "Awooo!" She glanced down at the necklace she held in her hands. It was the hilt of a sword. The pommel was a moonstone held in place with steel wire. The moonstone glowed a bright blue in the presence of the moon. She turned her attention back to the glowing celestial body.
"Dear Moon Mother, it is your wolf daughter, Awoomoon. I hold a keepsake dear to me. Please let him down so he may guide me in these troubling times." She clutched the hilt tight and the blue glow bled through her hands. She sat there in the stillness, listening to the wind blow, and shivering in the cold.
A voice whispered through the air, carried softly by the wind. "The time is nigh, she finds the lie. Hiding truth a sin, losing next of kin."
"But how can I?" A tear fell from Awoomoon's eye. "I'll lose her. She won't trust me ever again."
The wind changed direction. "Hold me close tight, still in my sight. My beloved bride, I am by your side." The wind blew around Awoomoon, creating a funnel around her. Then it faded into the night moon. The moonstone hilt dimmed.
Awoomoon let loose a tear. And then another. Then a whole stream. She knelt face first onto the rock and pounded it with her first. "I love you. I miss you." She squeezed the hilt one last time. Then she stood, letting the hilt necklace rest on her chest.
"Awooo!"

Chapter 3
CLANK! CLANK!
Ersatzica hammered metal and wood together with the hammer she rescued from the cat with the triangle hat. Scraps and pieces of both material were scattered around here work station slab. In the center nearest her stood one of the boots. A certain section of the mechanical workings faced Ersatzica as she hammered away at the appendage lying on the slab.
CLANK! CLANK!
"Ersie! Ersie!" called a familiar voice.
Ersatzica looked up from her work and over at Mudrich, who was lying in the hammock. She also perked her ears and listened.
"Ersie!" Lemilay appeared from behind a tree and stepped lightly down into Ersatzica's work area.
Ersatzica turned away and piled scraps onto the boot. With a sheepish grin, she faced Lemilay. "Hi, Lemilay." She leaned against the stone slab in front of the boot.
"Ersie," Lemilay said, "A certain you-know-what is missing from the you-know-where. Do you know where it is?"
"I haven't a clue what you mean." Ersatzica stole a quick glance behind her to make sure the boot was covered.
Lemilay glared. "Ok, well, if you don't have it..." Lemilay turned around and lifted her tail up. "I'll just have to find where it went myself."
Ersatzica sighed. "I have it."
Lemilay faced her and held out a hand, motioning her fingers towards her. "Give it."
Ersatzica uncovered it from the scrap pile, but hugged it. "But I need it."
"You used it to get Garoftle's Hammer, which I am also loaning to you, and now you need to give it back."
"But it has useful information." Ersatzica ran her finger over the intricate mechanical gears and springs on the side. "I'm learning a lot by studying it. These mechanisms will greatly help me craft Mudrich's leg."
Lemilay raised an eyebrow. "That's not an appropriate use for heirlooms."
Ersie's ears drooped and her hopeful smile vanished into a disappointed frown. "Here." She handed the boot to Lemilay, and dug out its pair.
"Thank you. Goodbye."
Then Yosummit comes and stops the triangle hat cat from maiming Ersatzica with an arrow. Using the hammer makes a lot of noise, so Lemilay lets Ersatzica use the boots to keep the hammer quiet. While using the boots in her cat form, she starts to take a liking to it, and often sneaks off into the middle of the night as a cat. She goes over to the triangle hat cat and asks her for assistance.

Chapter UNKNOWN
[2020-08-15: EXPAND]
Ersatzica wanted to show her family the trick she could do with the boots and changing into a cat, but was a bit unsure. So she showed Mudrich first, and Mudrich decided they should throw a whole show. It was all in the presentation. So Ersatzica invited all of her closest family and friends to the show one evening.
"Thank you all for coming here today." Ersatzica bowed to her audience, which consisted of Lemilay, Wryonin, Mother, Yosummit, and Great Granfork. They sat around the Drum Tree circle opposite the Drum Tree. Mudrich was working the special effects, from behind the tree. "I have something special to show you all." She gestured to her wolf body. "Today, right before your very eyes, I shall transform into that which you most despise." She tilted her head downward and gazed at the audience. "Moonacoonaloona!"
An explosion came from behind the tree and covered Ersatzica in smoke. When the smoke cleared, Ersatzica the wolf was no longer there. In her place stood Ersatzica the cat. She sported the boots that she had taken from Great Granfork's cabin.
The audience gasped in shock. Wryonin stood up. Mother's eyes shot wide open. Lemilay sweated. Great Granfork adjusted his glasses.
"It is but a trick, a scam! For now I shall turn back to who I am!" Ersatzica did a twirl. "Moonacoonaloona!"
Another explosion from behind the Drum Tree obscured the audience's view of Ersatzica. When it settled, the normal wolf Ersatzica stood there, bowing. Her bare paws were spaced apart from each other.
The audience cheered. Wryonin clapped vigorously. Yosummit howled. Mother clapped, holding her hands as high as her head. Lemilay sweated. Great Granfork slapped his palm with his other palm.
Mother left, Great Granfork went back to his business, Wryonin left, and Yosummit left after hugging Ersie and telling her what a good job she did with her trick. Lemilay stuck around.
"Wow, great show, Ersie." Lemilay smiled with her mouth but pinched her forehead with her eyebrows. "How ever did you pull off a trick like that?"
"Well, I--" Ersatzica picked up the boots.
"A professional never reveals their secrets!" exclaimed Mudrich. "But it was me. I threw the dirt clouds."
"You used the boots, didn't you?!" Lemilay poked Ersatzica in the stomach.
"Of course I did. Did you think I could spontaneously turn into a cat at will?" Ersie held the boots up.
"No, you used the boots to cover up how you actually pulled off the trick."
"No, I put the boots on, I say the magic words, and I turn into a cat." Ersatzica set the boots down.
"I've scoured every bit of history I could find, and I've never heard of these boots turning any wolves into cats."
"Well they do." Ersie shrugged.
"Well then show me." Lemilay crossed her arms.
"Ok." Ersie sat on the ground and put her wolf paws into the boots. "I wish I was a cat." Her face peeled off and turned into a mask. Her body became that of her cat form. She put her paws all the way into the boots and clasped them. She stood up and spread her arms out and smiled at Lemilay. Her wolf skin drooped to the ground.
Lemilay gasp. "Oh my coons!" She covered her mouth with her hands.
Ersie reached down and unclasped the boots. "See? The boots turn me into a cat!"
Lemilay shook her head. "No, no, no. You're a cat."
"Yeah, I am. I'm Retriyoan, the original owner of these boots."
"I can't believe I never saw it before." Lemilay faced away from Ersatzica. "You have the same markings."
"Yeah, because the boots turn me into her."
Lemilay stared at her, eyebrows furrowed.
Ersie took the boots off and put her wolf skin back on. "I'm sorry I upset you, Lemilay. I only wanted to show off the cool abilities of these boots, and explain how I was able to get Garoftle's Hammer back."
"Well that's the thing, Ersie." Lemilay hung her head. "It's not the boots. It's the skin." She took the boots and set them out of reach of Ersatzica. "Now say the magic words."
Ersatzica held her hands up in front of her chest and frowned.
"Say them."
"I wish I was a cat." Ersie turned into a cat, and took off her wolf skin. She held it in her hands and looked into its eye holes.
"It's not the boots turning you into a cat, it's the Skin of Monassus that's been keeping you a wolf. You're a cat, Ersie."
"But I don't want to be a cat. I want to be a wolf."
"Well it's too bad. You're a cat." Lemilay growled. "It all makes sense now. You've always acted like a cat. You've never been a true wolf." Lemilay ran off.
Ersatzica reached out. "Lemilay! Wait!" But it was too late to catch her. She turned around to Mudrich. "Mudrich..."
Mudrich was sweating. She shook her head. She took a step back with her mechanical leg. "Please don't hurt me." She turned around and ran away.
Ersatzica fell onto her knees and cried into her white cat hands. "What did I do? Why do I deserve this?"
She heard some footsteps approaching. She grabbed the wolf skin and put it on, but it didn't do anything. She tossed it aside. She addressed the stranger approaching her. "Stay away! Leave me alone!"
But it was Mother. "Hello, my pup."
"Mother? You're not mad?"
Mother sighed. "It's ok, Ersatzica. I'm not mad." She sat down behind her and cradled her in her arms.
"But, I'm a cat. I'm... a cat?" A tear dripped down Ersatzica's face. "Our worst enemy?"
"Hush, my pup." Mother nuzzled her. "It'll be alright. I have something to tell you."
"You knew?"
Mother nodded. "A long time ago, your cat mother brought you here. She was a brave warrior."
"What was her name?"
"Pantrinome."
"Pantrinome..."
"She brought you here, and asked that I look after you." Mother stroked Ersatzica's long red hair. "I have given you my very best care, have I not."
"You have." Ersatzica rubbed her head against Mother's. "But I'm a cat?"
"You are." Mother held Ersatzica's held and moved it so she could look into her eyes. "And you are a beautiful cat."
Ersatzica laid her head in Mother's chest and cried.
Mother pulled her in close. "It's ok, my pup... my kitten. I've always loved you, and I always will."
