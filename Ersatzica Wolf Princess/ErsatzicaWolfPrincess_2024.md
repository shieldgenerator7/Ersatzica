# Chapter 1 - Ersatzica

A slender, black-and-white wolf girl inspected her patient on the worktable. It was a leather belt with scratches in one particular place that eventually cut all the way through. Attached to it were several items of use to their owner: a bag of rocks, a knife in its sheath, a bladder, and a wooden slingshot.

The wolf girl looked around her workshop. It was a comfortable organized chaos, full of past projects, tools, plans, and materials. She opened a cupboard of dried skins and pulled out a sheet.

Taking out her trusty screwdriver, she sliced the leather, cutting off a thin strip. She sprawled the belt flat across her worktable and laid the strip on top of it. She sewed it together, over the course of a half hour, making the belt as good as new.

The owner wasn’t here to test it out, so she tried it on herself. She dug her paws into the bag of rocks and easily pulled out one. Check. She unsheathed and sheathed the knife. Check. She took out the bladder, pretended to drink from it, and put it back. Check. She unholstered the slingshot and tried to re-holster it, but a wooden spike on the slingshot scraped across the belt. Uncheck.

She placed the culprit on the worktable, leaning over it. “I want to saw this spike off, but he told me not to.” She contemplated it, and finally decided to search for her sawblade. “If I don’t, he’ll wear a cut into his belt again.” She sawed the spike off and filed the rough edges off with her screwdriver.

She holstered the slingshot onto the belt. Check.

*KNOCK KNOCK*

“Ersie, can I come in?”

Ersie took off the belt she had just finished repairing. “Come in.”

The door burst open, releasing a short, all-white wolf girl. She ran up to Ersie, bouncing up and down, dried mud patches flopping to the ground. “Did you finish it? Did you did you?”

“Calm down, Muddy.” Ersie pushed her back. “It’s right here.” She pulled out a metal hammer from a barrel that was about as big as the white wolf girl was.

Muddy grabbed it and swung it. “This feels great!” She hit the door, knocking the locking mechanism askew.

“Not in here!”

“Oh, right. Sorry, Ersie.”

“Now, you need to take better care of it. I managed to scrape off all the rust spots, and I added a coat of sealant to make it water resistant, but you have to keep it indoors.”

“But then how will I know where I left off with my tunnel progress?”

“That’s what this is for.” Ersie handed her a stake with a stitched-together cloth attached to the end.

“Oh! This is wonderful!” Muddy stuck it in the cracks between the stones that made up the floor.

“I’m glad you like it. I made it out of scraps from my workbench.”

“Thanks so much, Ersie!” Muddy gave Ersie a big squeezer hug.

“No problem, Muddy.” Ersie tapped her.

Muddy let her go. “Do you want to come help me with a new hole?”

“Not today, Muddy. I got stuff to do.”

“Ok, see you later!” Muddy ran out.

Ersie got to work on the next project: two identical drums. They had once been attached together by a belt, but that belt had since worn away. The drums were painted red with a gold trim, and had impeccable craftsmanship. A blue glint shimmered across the drums. Ersie felt a closeness to them that she couldn’t explain, like the drums were welcoming her to work on them.

“Ersatzica?”

“Come in.”

A black and grey wolf boy pushed the workshop door open and marched inside. “How’s it coming?”

Ersatzica looked up at him as she handed him the belt. “I fixed your belt, like you asked. I stitched it up, good as new, it should last a lot longer now.”

Wryonin wrapped the belt around his waist and felt around for the items. “Where’s the slingshot?”

“Now, don’t be mad, but…”

“Ersatzica, what did you do?”

She held the slingshot behind her back. “Your belt could break again, and what if it happened while fighting the cats?”

“Please don’t tell me you did what I think you did.”

“And you cut yourself all the time by accident. And… and you don’t even look at your slingshot while shooting it, so…”

“Ersatzica, hand me my slingshot.”

“Promise not to get mad?”

“Give it to me.” He reached behind her to grab it.

“Promise?”

He grabbed it and pulled it out of her hand. Inspecting it, he found it lacking a particular spike. “Ersatzica! This was grandfather’s! He carved it with his own paws! And you went and destroyed it.” He mimed shooting it. “How am I supposed to aim now?” He mimed throwing it on the ground, but nevertheless holstered it. “Thanks a lot.” He stormed off.

Ersatzica leaned over her workshop, tears welling up in her eyes. She picked up her screwdriver and slowly fiddled with an adjustment knob on the drums, but then dropped the screwdriver.

“Ha! I knew it!”

Ersatzica sucked in her tears and turned around.

A grey and white wolf walked in, eyes rolled back into her skull. A white bald spot on her forehead glowed enough illuminate the scene. “I told you so! I knew he would get mad.”

“What do you want, Lemilay?”

Lemilay rolled her eyes forward, dimming out her bald spot. “My throne is getting uncomfy. It needs some more stuffing.”

“I just put more quills in your pillow last week.”

“Well, it needs some more.” Lemilay brushed aside the drums and set her “throne” pillow onto Ersatzica’s workbench in their wake. “Bye for now, I’ll be back after dinner.”

“I’ll have it done by tomorrow.”

“Hmmm.” Lemilay lifted her chin at Ersatzica. “Very well. I graciously grant you a deadline extension.” She swiped Ersatzica’s chin with the tip of her tail. With a glowing bald spot, she added, “I see Mudrich broke your door again. Better get that fixed.” She didn’t even bother to close the door as she left.

Ersatzica stewed on her stool for a minute, and then got to work on the pillows. They were plenty puffy, they just seemed flat after hours of being sat on. She fluffed them out without even using her tools. For good measure, she straightened the fur grain on the top.

Ersatzica then pushed the pillow aside to make room for the drums. She cut out a strip of leather to fit around her own waist and laid out the drums along it, meticulously calculating where best to put them. She placed them right next to each on the front. Then she attached them to the belt.

Putting the belt on, she immediately realized a problem: the drums sagged forward, causing the whole belt to droop. Uncheck.

Well why had this not happened with Wryonin’s belt? There was nothing on it that was that heavy. Wait, yeah there was. The bag of rocks, and the bladder. So why did that work, but this doesn’t?

Ersatzica took out a piece of paper and a pencil, sketching out her memory of Wryonin’s utility belt. She soon discovered that the heavy items were on opposite sides of the belt, balancing it out.

Aha!

With that in mind, Ersatzica detached the drums and laid them out so they were on either side of the belt. Her stomach rumbled as she sewed them back on.

Putting the belt back on, she found that the belt didn’t droop as much. Check! But the drums still didn’t seem to be attached properly. Uncheck.

Her stomach rumbled.

She pressed on, taking the belt off and preparing to detach the drums again.

“Ersie! Help!” Mudrich burst through the door.

“What’s wrong, Muddy?”

“My stake is broken!”

“How that happen?”

“I was trying to pound it into the ground, but when I hit it with my hammer, it just snapped instead.”

“Oh, Muddy, you weren’t supposed to pound it with your hammer.”

“I wasn’t?”

“No, you were supposed to…”

Ersie’s stomach growled.

“Ersie! Did you skip dinner again?”

“I had a snack earlier.”

“You mean leather and wood chips?”

“Maybe?”

“Come on, Ersie, let’s go eat.”

They were a bit late to the mess hall. Most wolves were already finished eating and tossing their leftover bones onto the bone pile.
