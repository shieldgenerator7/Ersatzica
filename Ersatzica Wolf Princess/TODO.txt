[Revisions]
* Don't hand wave lemilays ability at the beginning. Make it so one can easily figure out shes using Hindsight and how shes using it to get information
* Describe path to wolf village near end of chapter 1
* Have wryonin check in on ersie in chapter 2
* Make a scene where its more obvious how lemilay's Hindsight works (maybe when theyre going back to the village)
* make AWOOO! more consistent: make it be an onomatopea when wolves do it genuinely, and put it in quotation marks when they mimic it or another species tries to howl
* account for dodge training in chapter 4
* add scenes of Ersatzica trying out boot modifications for a week or so during chapter 4
* fix the story of Quivester in Chapter 6 to be more consistent with the canon version, or have it be reasonably close / something that would inspire Fisher
* talk about claw training in chapter 6 meeting with Fisher
* previously mention Ersie's rule: ‘leave your work in your workshop’ (even if it ends up being someone else's rule imposed on her)
* figure out if they'd use a pencil or some other writing utensil
