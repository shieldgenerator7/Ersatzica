# Wryonin’s Winter

*This short story takes place after the events of Ersatzica: Wolf Princess, and takes place during the sequel.*

# Chapter 1

A bird tweeting outside the building broke Wryonin from his slumber.

As he opened his tired eyes, he looked across his bed to the other bunk beyond. The empty bed stared back. Rubbing his eyes, he sat up in bed. “Come on, Mudrich, we don’t want to be late for training.”

No response.

Wryonin sighed. He jumped off his top bunk and landed with a thud on the floor. He pulled out his slingshot and shot the form in the bunk under the empty one.

*PLINK!*

His frustrated expression turned bitter. His ears pinned back and his lips turned up, exposing his sharp teeth. Then he looked at the ground, tail suddenly still, arms laying at his side.

Footsteps moved around outside, a woodpecker pounded a tree, dew fell from leaves, and a sleeping figure awoke from the bed next to him.

“Wryonin?” Lemilay yawned. “Was that you?”

“Hmm?” Wryonin looked up. “Yeah, yeah that was me.”

“What are you doing?”

“…target practice.”

“Do it outside.” Lemilay snuggled into her pillow and went back to sleep. She breathed steadily and silently, so fitting for a petite future chief.

Wryonin chuckled. If Mudrich was here, she’d be snoring up a storm. Half the time she *was* the early-morning town crier. It had been Wryonin’s long-time wish to be able to sleep in, and now that he could, it felt bittersweet.

He moved a hand towards Mudrich’s bed, where her hammer lay underneath the sheets. He hesitated. Then he turned away, and walked out the door.

“Is it all possible you could shut the door LOUDER?” Lemilay muttered from within.

Wryonin rolled his eyes and continued on his way.

“Hey, Wryonin!” A silver-backed wolf waved him down from the staircase.

“Mornin’, Tetsuhi.” Wryonin approached him.

“Going to training today?”

“Nah, I’m probably going to train by myself again today.”

“You don’t like the new cat coach, do you?”

Wryonin shrugged. “He’s not rigorous enough. Uncle Calustar worked us much harder.”

“You should be the new coach.” Tetsuhi punched Wryonin in the shoulder.

“Ha!” Wryonin pushed him into the wall on the staircase. “I could never…”

“C’mon, you’d be great!”

“I could never… divulge my secrets!”

Tetsuhi let out a chuckle.

Wryonin parted ways and ran off into the woods contained within the confines of the river and the cliffs.

Off in the distance, several wolves yipped and howled as they pounded the ground in their morning exercises. All around, birds chirped and squirrels scurried around.

Wryonin made his way to one of the last standing lookout posts, avoiding contact with the other wolves. It was the muddy hut that barely qualified as a lookout post, being made of mud and stone instead of wood and screws. But it felt safer than the other posts.

Wryonin sniffed the mudworking, but he was left disappointed. It didn’t smell strongly of Mudrich, as it didn’t have much of a smell at all. Wryonin wrinkled his nose, massaging it with his paw pads. He took a deep breath in, finally drawing in some sort of a scent: the musty smell of wet dirt. It wasn’t much, but it was enough.

Wryonin sighed. He looked out the single, deformed window across the river. He lifted his slingshot and drew a rock in it.

A tear fell from his eye, interrupting his focus. He punched the wall and growled. “Why? Why did you have to do that? I *told* you to fallback!”

He fell to his knees, covering his face with his hands. Tears threatened to leak out of his eyes. He sucked them up, and growled.

*AWOOO!* “Intruders!”

Wryonin stood up at attention. He looked around, but didn’t see any cats. He hadn’t heard the intruder alarm since the cats took over. Whoever the intruder was, it wasn’t a cat this time.

Wryonin gathered himself and rushed through the woods to the stairs. Looking up, the wolves and cats who were at training were already at the top. He climbed up the stairs as fast as he could, hurriedly getting to the top.

But before he could, a burly-armed spider crawled over the edge and ambushed him. It had eight furious black-filled pit eyes, two of which were central and bigger than the others. It had a torso with two arms, each with hands at the end. Its six legs stuck to the cliff edge, letting it walk on walls. It flung its tan furry arms at Wryonin, sending a spray of barbed hairs his way.

Wryonin guarded his face with his arm, taking the pricks head-on. They hurt like tiny needles, and itched like mosquito bites. But his adrenaline kicked in, and he set his focus on the spider. He launched a volley of round pebbles at the spider’s face, hitting it in the mandibles, the cheek, and in one of its big eyes.

The spider shrieked and mumbled in an unknown language, covering its face as it fled the scene along the wall, avoiding returning back to the top.

Wryonin shot it in the abdomen as it fled, but it didn’t seem to hurt it. He ran to the top of the stairs, peeking up over the edge of the plateau to see what was going on.

It was chaos. Giant man-shaped muscular spiders ran everywhere, screaming at everyone. They crawled over the buildings, walking up the walls and windows. Female wolves, children, and deer screamed from within the buildings. Some spiders must also have broken into the buildings.

The wolf warriors and cat warriors worked together to beat down the spiders, leaving their battered corpses on the ground where they were slain.

“Mudrich would’ve loved this.” He thought out loud.

Wryonin responded to the closest cry he could hear. A spider was encroaching upon a young wolf mother and her newborn pups in their house. The door was wide open as if they had just invited the spider in.

Wryonin growled and barked at the spider, successfully getting its attention. He shot it in the back with a rock, slightly cracking its exoskeleton.

The spider hissed and threatened him in its own tongue. It lunged at him, causing him to jump back. Then it spun a web around the doorway.

Wryonin clawed at the web, but when he touched it, he felt suddenly weaker. The web turned blood red where he had touched it, and his finger had small lacerations.

This was weird. Usually the spiders they fought were small, like the size of wolf pups. And they did use webs, but not intelligently like this spider. This attack was different. Wryonin fired a shot into the web, but the pebble was caught in it, and didn’t penetrate it.

He went around the side of the building, and threw a stone into the window, shattering it. “Quick, this way!” He reached in and grabbed the pups.

The mother was facing down the spider. When he called, she turned to look at him.

In that moment, the spider advanced and bit her in the neck.

She clawed at it, but couldn't break free.

Wryonin shot it with a pebble in the forehead, sending the projectile straight past the wolf mother’s ear.

The spider hissed in pain, reeling backwards, hand on head.

The wolf mother took the opportunity to exit out the window. She whimpered as she took her pups in her arms.

“Get to the town square.” Wryonin directed. He looked back at the broken window.

The spider hissed at him as it boarded up the window with more spider web, trapping itself inside.

Wryonin climbed a nearby building to get a better vantage point. The town was an absolute storm. Noises everywhere, all so very loud that any one of them could be the one to deafen him. But more interestingly, once the spiders entered a building, they webbed up the entrances, and then stayed there.

His ears pricked. A low whir, although faint, buzzed just under all the screams and battle cries. He jumped from building to building, pausing on each roof to listen for the whir. He followed it to the source of the spiders coming from the mountain pass.

He jumped onto the building closest to the place where the spiders were rushing in from. This building had already been evacuated and boarded up with webs. Spiders rushed past him, climbing over the building’s walls and roof trying to find a way in, but skipping past when they quickly realized it was occupied by another spider.

Wryonin hid behind a chimney, which the spiders thankfully walked around rather than over. They pushed past him as they scurried, completely ignoring him as they bumped into him.

He climbed up the chimney to get a better vantage point without close contact with the spiders, many of which had spiky, itchy furs on their exoskeletons. From there, he could see several more waves of spiders coming in from the mountains. He shot at some of them from a distance, but they kept coming.

“I could cause an avalanche, but that might delay the supply wagon, which should be coming any day now.” Wryonin pondered.

He took a deep breath and let out a loud howl. *AWOOOOOOO!*

The spiders around him scattered. Wryonin nodded.

He jumped off the building and howled on the ground, scaring the spiders away from him. He stepped closer to the village, howling long and loud. The spiders that could hear him ran around him. But the horde kept coming.

Wryonin ran back to the village to regroup with the wolf warriors. He howled to get their attention. “Brothers and sisters of the moon god! Sheath your swords! Howl with me!” He howled loudly, showing them what happens.

The other wolves howled with him, and the spiders ran around them. Wryonin led them through the village to the edge, where they slowly pushed the spiders out around them, and eventually persuaded them to flee in another direction besides straight through the wolf village.

After a half hour of scaring a fleeing horde of spiders to run somewhere else, it was time to deal with the boarded up buildings.

*AWOOO!* Wryonin howled. “Where?”

*AWOOO!* Lemilay responded. “Here.”

Wryonin followed her howls to her location. She was in the barracks, sitting behind the locked door behind their room. Wryonin knocked and she let him in. “Lemilay, are you alright?”

“Where were you?” Lemilay growled. “I’ve been holed up in this pit for hours! A spider could’ve broken down this door at any point and eaten me!”

“You slept through the attack, didn’t you?” Wryonin groaned.

“Don’t you tell anyone, I’ll deny it.”

“Well, here’s the debrief. It’s a spider attack, but these ones are big—”

“Adults?”

“Probably. And they’ve taken several buildings. We need to clear—”

“It sounds like you’re asking for help. Step aside, I’ve got this.”

Wryonin stared at her straight. He didn’t roll his eyes.

“You’re not going to gripe at me taking charge?”

“I’ve got something to investigate.” Wryonin left, leaving the door open.

“Close the door when you leave! It’s freezing out!”

“I thought you were taking charge! Wake up, sleepy head!”

Lemilay grumbled as she puffed up her fur and left the building.

Wryonin could still hear the whirring. Whatever it was, it wasn’t normal, and was probably the cause of the spider stampede.

He stopped by the cafeteria on his way out, packing a few supplies for a journey in the mountains. Then he left down the trail, following the whirring sound.

# Chapter 2

Wryonin walked down the mountainous path.

# Chapter ?

Wryonin opened his weary eyes, peeking up over the edge of his bed to the one beyond his feet. It was empty, left messy as the day she left it. His head fell back into the pillow. His conscious told him to flip open the covers and jump out of bed, but he didn’t.

A furry wolf paw tapped the edge of the bed. “You awake, Wry?” Lemilay looked up at him from the lower bunk.

He turned over to address her. “Yeah.”

“Well, good. It’s time for breakfast.”

“I’ll be right there.”

Lemilay made her bed, and stood in the middle of the room.

Wryonin watched, clinging to the edge of his bunk.

Her baldspot glowed a bright white and her eyes rolled into the back of her head. She stared at the empty bunkbed where Ersatzica and Mudrich used to sleep. Her resting neutral expression turned up into a smile.

After a minute, she left.

Wryonin laid back down in his bed and exhaled. He climbed down the ladder and examined the lower bunk.

The sheets were all piled in one corner without a care. Specks of dirt and mud littered the otherwise white cloth. The pillow was smashed in from years of use, crumbs sticking out from under it. A “battle hammer” welded together from a worn-down anvil and an old light post laid in the bed. A blue shimmer ran across it.

Wryonin knelt down in front of the bed. “Hi, Mudrich.” He laid a hand on the hammer. “I had a dream about you last night. You, me…” He sucked air in through his nose. “You, me, and Lemilay were walking to the mess hall for breakfast. Even Ersatzica was there. She was staying for the week.” He paused. “Well anyway, someone questioned your food throwing abilities, so you threw some peas at them.” Wryonin laughed, smiling through his downtrodden demeanor. “You threw the peas so hard they turned green for the rest of their life.” He wiped his eyes on his furry arm. “You sure showed him!”

The hammer shimmered in the sunlight.

“Reminds me of all the good times he had throwing food.” He shook his head, laughing.

Wryonin shivered. Outside, it was snowing.

“I’m sorry, Mudrich.” His forehead rested on the hammer. “I… I couldn’t protect you. I couldn’t even avenge you. Lemilay scoured the whole history of the… of the… place, and she confirmed it. The cat responsible for this is already dead.”

His eyes teared up as his fists balled in rage. He slammed them on the hammer handle. “That murderer took you from me and didn’t even have the decency to stick around so I could kill him!”

He sat on the floor, hands on his knees. “I want to avenge you, but there’s nothing to avenge.”

He breathed in, and he breathed out. The hammer lay in the bed. He breathed in, and he breathed out. The hammer shimmered in the sunlight.

*AWOOO!* Lemilay howled. “Where?”

*AWOOO!* Wryonin responded. “On my way.”

He placed a hand on the hammer. “I miss you, Mudrich.” He closed his eyes tightly, futilely trying to prevent a tear from falling from his eye.

He left the room.
