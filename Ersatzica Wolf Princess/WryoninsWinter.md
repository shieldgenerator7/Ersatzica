# Wryonin’s Winter

*This short story takes place after the events of Ersatzica: Wolf Princess, and takes place during the sequel.*

Wryonin opened his weary eyes, peeking up over the edge of his bed to the one beyond his feet. It was empty, left messy as the day she left it. His head fell back into the pillow. His conscious told him to flip open the covers and jump out of bed, but he didn’t.

A furry wolf paw tapped the edge of the bed. “You awake, Wry?” Lemilay looked up at him from the lower bunk.

He turned over to address her. “Yeah.”

“Well, good. It’s time for breakfast.”

“I’ll be right there.”

Lemilay made her bed, and stood in the middle of the room.

Wryonin watched, clinging to the edge of his bunk.

Her baldspot glowed a bright white and her eyes rolled into the back of her head. She stared at the empty bunkbed where Ersatzica and Mudrich used to sleep. Her resting neutral expression turned up into a smile.

After a minute, she left.

Wryonin laid back down in his bed and exhaled. He climbed down the ladder and examined the lower bunk.

The sheets were all piled in one corner without a care. Specks of dirt and mud littered the otherwise white cloth. The pillow was smashed in from years of use, crumbs sticking out from under it. A “battle hammer” welded together from a worn-down anvil and an old light post laid in the bed. A blue shimmer ran across it.

Wryonin knelt down in front of the bed. “Hi, Mudrich.” He laid a hand on the hammer. “I had a dream about you last night. You, me…” He sucked air in through his nose. “You, me, and Lemilay were walking to the mess hall for breakfast. Even Ersatzica was there. She was staying for the week.” He paused. “Well anyway, someone questioned your food throwing abilities, so you threw some peas at them.” Wryonin laughed, smiling through his downtrodden demeanor. “You threw the peas so hard they turned green for the rest of their life.” He wiped his eyes on his furry arm. “You sure showed him!”

The hammer shimmered in the sunlight.

“Reminds me of all the good times he had throwing food.” He shook his head, laughing.

Wryonin shivered. Outside, it was snowing.

“I’m sorry, Mudrich.” His forehead rested on the hammer. “I… I couldn’t protect you. I couldn’t even avenge you. Lemilay scoured the whole history of the… of the… place, and she confirmed it. The cat responsible for this is already dead.”

His eyes teared up as his fists balled in rage. He slammed them on the hammer handle. “That murderer took you from me and didn’t even have the decency to stick around so I could kill him!”

He sat on the floor, hands on his knees. “I want to avenge you, but there’s nothing to avenge.”

He breathed in, and he breathed out. The hammer lay in the bed. He breathed in, and he breathed out. The hammer shimmered in the sunlight.

*AWOOO!* Lemilay howled. “Where?”

*AWOOO!* Wryonin responded. “On my way.”

He placed a hand on the hammer. “I miss you, Mudrich.” He closed his eyes tightly, futilely trying to prevent a tear from falling from his eye.

He left the room.
