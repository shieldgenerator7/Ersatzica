# Ersatzica Characters

This document is for keeping track of details of the characters in Ersatzica's story.

# Ersatzica

Main character

_A slender, black and white wolf pulls a strap tight around her waist._

# Mudrich

Ersatzica's wolf sister

_A shorter, stockier, white wolf punched the air in front of her, incidentally shaking off some of the caked mud that had accumulated on her fur._

# Lemilay

Ersatzica's "older" wolf sister

_Her grey and white fur blurred with the background, but the bald spot on her head was still clearly visible._

# Wryonin

Ersatzica's wolf brother

_A black and grey wolf stretched his muscles, flexing them with each drum beat._

# Awoomoon

Ersatzica's wolf mother

_Mother opened their bedroom door without knocking. A tall black and white wolf, her figure occupied the majority of the small doorframe. Her eyes were focused with intent. Her mouth betrayed no sign of a smile. The necklace dangling from her neck consisted of a single canine tooth. Her chest fur was neatly brushed. Her tail was half the length that it should have been._

aka Huripka (as a young wolf)
