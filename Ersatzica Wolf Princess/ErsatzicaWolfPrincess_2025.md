# Chapter 1 – The Drums of Retriyoan

A slender, black-and-white wolf girl inspected her patient on the worktable. It was a leather belt with scratches in one particular place that eventually cut all the way through. Attached to it were several items of use to their owner: a bag of rocks, a knife in its sheath, a bladder, and a wooden slingshot.

The wolf girl looked around her workshop. It was a comfortable organized chaos, full of past projects, tools, plans, and materials. She opened a cupboard of dried skins and pulled out a sheet.

Taking out her trusty screwdriver, she sliced the leather, cutting off a thin strip. She sprawled the belt flat across her worktable and laid the strip on top of it. She sewed it together, over the course of a half hour, making the belt as good as new.

The owner wasn’t here to test it out, so she tried it on herself. She dug her paws into the bag of rocks and easily pulled out one. Check. She unsheathed and sheathed the knife. Check. She took out the bladder, pretended to drink from it, and put it back. Check. She unholstered the slingshot and tried to re-holster it, but a wooden spike on the slingshot scraped across the belt. Uncheck.

She placed the culprit on the worktable, leaning over it. “I want to saw this spike off, but he told me not to.” She contemplated it, and finally decided to search for her sawblade. “If I don’t, he’ll wear a cut into his belt again.” She sawed the spike off and filed the rough edges off with her screwdriver.

She holstered the slingshot onto the belt. Check.

*KNOCK KNOCK*

“Ersie, can I come in?”

Ersie took off the belt she had just finished repairing. “Come in.”

The door burst open, releasing a short, all-white wolf girl. She ran up to Ersie, bouncing up and down, dried mud patches flopping to the ground. “Did you finish it? Did you did you?”

“Calm down, Muddy.” Ersie pushed her back. “It’s right here.” She pulled out a metal hammer from a barrel that was about as big as the white wolf girl was.

Muddy grabbed it and swung it. “This feels great!” She hit the door, knocking the locking mechanism askew.

“Not in here!”

“Oh, right. Sorry, Ersie.”

“Now, you need to take better care of it. I managed to scrape off all the rust spots, and I added a coat of sealant to make it water resistant, but you have to keep it indoors.”

“But then how will I know where I left off with my tunnel progress?”

“That’s what this is for.” Ersie handed her a stake with a stitched-together cloth attached to the end.

“Oh! This is wonderful!” Muddy stuck it in the cracks between the stones that made up the floor.

“I’m glad you like it. I made it out of scraps from my workbench.”

“Thanks so much, Ersie!” Muddy gave Ersie a big squeezer hug.

“No problem, Muddy.” Ersie tapped her.

Muddy let her go. “Do you want to come help me with a new hole?”

“Not today, Muddy. I got stuff to do.”

“Ok, see you later!” Muddy ran out.

Ersie got to work on the next project: two identical drums. They had once been attached together by a belt, but that belt had since worn away. The drums were painted red with a gold trim, and had impeccable craftsmanship. A blue glint shimmered across the drums. Ersie felt a closeness to them that she couldn’t explain, like the drums were welcoming her to work on them.

“Ersatzica?”

“Come in.”

A black and grey wolf boy pushed the workshop door open and marched inside. “How’s it coming?”

Ersatzica looked up at him as she handed him the belt. “I fixed your belt, like you asked. I stitched it up, good as new, it should last a lot longer now.”

Wryonin wrapped the belt around his waist and felt around for the items. “Where’s the slingshot?”

“Now, don’t be mad, but…”

“Ersatzica, what did you do?”

She held the slingshot behind her back. “Your belt could break again, and what if it happened while fighting the cats?”

“Please don’t tell me you did what I think you did.”

“And you cut yourself all the time by accident. And… and you don’t even look at your slingshot while shooting it, so…”

“Ersatzica, hand me my slingshot.”

“Promise not to get mad?”

“Give it to me.” He reached behind her to grab it.

“Promise?”

He grabbed it and pulled it out of her hand. Inspecting it, he found it lacking a particular spike. “Ersatzica! This was grandfather’s! He carved it with his own paws! And you went and destroyed it.” He mimed shooting it. “How am I supposed to aim now?” He mimed throwing it on the ground, but nevertheless holstered it. “Thanks a lot.” He stormed off.

Ersatzica leaned over her workshop, tears welling up in her eyes. She picked up her screwdriver and slowly fiddled with an adjustment knob on the drums, but then dropped the screwdriver.

“Ha! I knew it!”

Ersatzica sucked in her tears and turned around.

A grey and white wolf walked in, eyes rolled back into her skull. A white bald spot on her forehead glowed enough illuminate the scene. “I told you so! I knew he would get mad.”

“What do you want, Lemilay?”

Lemilay rolled her eyes forward, dimming out her bald spot. “My throne is getting uncomfy. It needs some more stuffing.”

“I just put more quills in your pillow last week.”

“Well, it needs some more.” Lemilay brushed aside the drums and set her “throne” pillow onto Ersatzica’s workbench in their wake. “Bye for now, I’ll be back after dinner.”

“I’ll have it done by tomorrow.”

“Hmmm.” Lemilay lifted her chin at Ersatzica. “Very well. I graciously grant you a deadline extension.” She swiped Ersatzica’s chin with the tip of her tail. With a glowing bald spot, she added, “I see Mudrich broke your door again. Better get that fixed.” She didn’t even bother to close the door as she left.

Ersatzica stewed on her stool for a minute, and then got to work on the pillows. They were plenty puffy, they just seemed flat after hours of being sat on. She fluffed them out without even using her tools. For good measure, she straightened the fur grain on the top.

Ersatzica then pushed the pillow aside to make room for the drums. She cut out a strip of leather to fit around her own waist and laid out the drums along it, meticulously calculating where best to put them. She placed them right next to each on the front. Then she attached them to the belt.

Putting the belt on, she immediately realized a problem: the drums sagged forward, causing the whole belt to droop. Uncheck.

Well why had this not happened with Wryonin’s belt? There was nothing on it that was that heavy. Wait, yeah there was. The bag of rocks, and the bladder. So why did that work, but this doesn’t?

Ersatzica took out a piece of paper and a pencil, sketching out her memory of Wryonin’s utility belt. She soon discovered that the heavy items were on opposite sides of the belt, balancing it out.

Aha!

With that in mind, Ersatzica detached the drums and laid them out so they were on either side of the belt. Her stomach rumbled as she sewed them back on.

Putting the belt back on, she found that the belt didn’t droop as much. Check! But the drums still didn’t seem to be attached properly. Uncheck.

Her stomach rumbled.

She pressed on, taking the belt off and preparing to detach the drums again.

“Ersie! Help!” Mudrich burst through the door.

“What’s wrong, Muddy?”

“My stake is broken!”

“How that happen?”

“I was trying to pound it into the ground, but when I hit it with my hammer, it just snapped instead.”

“Oh, Muddy, you weren’t supposed to pound it with your hammer.”

“I wasn’t?”

“No, you were supposed to…”

Ersie’s stomach growled.

“Ersie! Did you skip dinner again?”

“I had a snack earlier.”

“You mean leather and wood chips?”

“Maybe?”

“Come on, Ersie, let’s go eat.”

They were a bit late to the mess hall. Most wolves were already finished eating and tossing their leftover bones onto the bone pile. Ersie helped herself to some of the leftovers, taking it with her.

Muddie looked up from picking through the bone pile. “Where you going?”

“Back to my workshop.”

“But it’s such a nice day out! Let’s go down to the river.”

“But I don’t want to eat where it’s wet.”

“Just eat on the way. Come on!”

Ersie followed Muddie to the river, eating her rations as she went. She finished well before they walked down the cliff stairs, through the forest, and to the river. She left a trail of bones as she went.

“So why the river?”

“I want to show you something.”

Muddie led her to big rock by the river, so close it was literally part of the river bank. The river roared up next to the boulder, threatening to swallow it up.

“It’s a boulder.”

“Not just any boulder!” Muddie tapped the boulder gently with her hammer. *TING TING*. “See?”

“That’s just the noise boulders make.”

“No, it’s not!” Muddie insisted. “I think there’s something inside it.”

“Like what?”

“I don’t know, minerals maybe?”

“Well if it did, why hasn’t it been mined yet?”

“Because it’s been buried under a hole bunch of dirt, until recently.” Muddie jumped onto the boulder island. “The river and I have done a fine job of finding it.” Muddie danced on the boulder.

Ersie, with the drums still attached to her side, banged on them. *BUM BUM BUM*

“Oh yeah!” Muddie danced to the music.

Muddie danced to the beat of Ersie’s drums .

“Whoa!” Muddie’s eyes went wide. “Did you feel that?”

“No, what happened?” *BUM BUM BUM*

“I’m not sure.” Muddie let her hands relax and her feet rest, but they didn’t want to. “Hey! Hey! Hey!”

“What’s wrong Muddie?”

“Stop playing the drums!”

*BUM BUM—*

“Whew!” Muddie took a deep breath. “That was intense.”

“It was?”

Muddie took another breath. “Alright, let’s go again. I think I have an idea how this heirloom works.”

*BUM BUM BUM*

Muddie danced to the beat of the drum.

“Faster.”

*BUM BUM BUM*

Muddie’s dancing increased in speed. “Faster.”

*BUM BUM BUM*

Muddie danced in a frenzy, moving at speeds that seemed impossible.

Ersie sped up the drums.

Muddie became a blur.

“Muddie, you good?”

She didn’t respond.

*BUM BUM—*

“Ah!” Muddie exclaimed. “Finally!” She knelt down and took a deep breath.

“How were you moving so fast?”

“It’s… the drums…” Muddie caught her breath. “You try.”

Ersie did a little jig with her feet.

*BUM BUM BUM*

She sped up the drums.

*BUM BUM BUM*

She increased the tempo again.

*BUM BUM BUM*

Her feet were still moving like normal. “Nothing’s happening.”

“You’re doing it wrong.”

“Are you sure? I’m doing exactly what you were doing.”

“No I was moving my arms. You know, the standard dance we do. You were just standing there like a tree.”

“Well I can’t move my arms and play the drums at the same time.”

“Ok I wanna try again.”

Ersie stopped dancing and focused on the drums.

*BUM BUM BUM*

“Muddie, you’re not dancing.”

“I’m trying something else.” She jogged in place, feet timed to the beat and arms pumping to the tempo.

*BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM*

“Ok now faster.”

Ersie gradually sped up the drums.

Muddie’s pace quickened as she jogged. Her legs soon became a blur.

*BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM*

Ersie blinked, and Muddie was gone. A huge gust of wind blew past her, leaving a trail of trampled leaves and muddy pawprints.

“Muddie?”

Ersie looked around, but there was no sign of Muddie.

*AWOOOO*. (“Here!”) Ersie howled.

*AWOOOO.* (“Here!”) Mudrich howled back. A minute later, she appeared from the woods, running at top speed. She was covered in mud from head to toe. Well, more than usual.

“What happened to you?”

“The most amazing thing ever, Ersie!”

“A fresh pile of mud?”

“I ran so fast with those drums!” Muddie got on all fours.

“Mudrich! Not here!”

Mudrich shook all the loose mud off here, splashing it all over Ersie and the drums.

“Oh, sorry Ersie.” She picked up her hammer. “Let’s try again.”

They tried the drums out on Mudrich’s hammer, finding that she can swing faster while under the influence of the drums. They tried other things, finding that it sped up Mudrich as long as she was synced to the beat first.

Ersie tried to get the same effect, but no matter what she did, she couldn’t get it to work.

Mudrich shrugged. “Maybe you’re just bad. I’ve got the beat.”

“No, I’m good at getting the beat too. It must be something else.”

“No you just suck, admit it.”

Ersie’s ears folded back. She slowed down the beat of the drums as Mudrich dug to the beat. She slowed the beat down to the starting beat, then further slower to about half as fast.

“Hey! What gives?” Mudrich shouted.

“What?”

“Why can’t I move any faster?”

Ersie stopped playing.

Mudrich let out an exasperated sigh. “Finally!” She dug some more. “Hey, who turned off the beat?”

“Mudrich.”

“It wasn’t me.”

“No, Mudrich!”

“Huh? Oh… oh!” Mudrich slapped herself in the forehead. “Of course! If it can speed me up, it can also slow me down. But why would I want that?”

“That’s what I want to ask Ersatzica.”

“Lemilay!” Ersatzica turned to her sister, who quietly approached. “What are you doing down here?”

“I’m not *afraid* of mud, you know.” Lemilay wiped her fur to brush some mud off. “And you also know *that* is not what I asked for.” She pointed up to the village.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“You know full well what I’m talking about. I asked you to—”

“Lemlem, check out what I can do!” Mudrich interjected, doing a quick jig.

“Brilliant.” Lemilay scoffed.

“Come on, Ersie, show her.”

Lemilay flashed her bald spot, her eyes rolling back into her skull. A second later, she returned to normal.

“Did you see it? Wasn’t it cool?”

“Great. So you two were down here partying instead of getting your job done? Wait until Mother hears about this.”

“Lemilay, don’t!” Ersatzica grabbed her by the arm. “I’ll get it done.”

Lemilay crossed her arms. “Ok, but I expect extra fluff.”

“Ok.”

“Lemilay! Did you see the jig! Did you see how quick—”

“I saw your damn jig, Mudrich!” Lemilay shouted.

“Well you don’t have to shout at me.”

“Well you don’t have to be so annoying.”

“But you should see it.”

“I *saw* it Mudrich. It’s just another stupid heirloom.”

“It’s not stupid.” Ersatzica’s ears pinned back.

“Can it repair my cushion? Can it tell the time? Can it keep people in line?”

“Hey that rhymed.”

“Shut up Mudrich.”

“No, but it can—”

“Then who cares? You two have fun with it, but only after getting your jobs done.”

“What’s going on?” Wryonin dropped down from a tree.

“Nothing, go away.”

“I heard shouting. I thought you were in trouble.”

“We’re fine.”

“You shouldn’t be out here this late. The cats—”

“Wryonin check this out!” Mudrich did her jig. “Come on, Ersie, show him.”

Ersie looked away.

“Come on, Ersie?”

Ersie mumbled, “Not right now, Muddie.”

“As I was saying, the cats have taken the area on the other side of the river. Meaning this area is surely next on their agenda.”

“Wryonin, we’re fine.” Lemilay walked away.

“Wait, we should all walk together.”

“We should *jig* together, right Ersie?”

Ersie followed her siblings, not saying anything.

“Everyone stop.” Wryonin froze.

Mudrich pretended to be a statue, standing on one leg. Ersatzica laid her hands on the drums as she stopped. Lemilay kept walking.

Wryonin’s ears twitched. “They’re here! Everyone run!” Wryonin took off toward the stairs. *AWOOOOO!* (“Intruders!”)

“It was probably just a twig.” Lemilay pulled out a telescope. She looked into it, then froze.

“Lemlem?”

Lemilay twitched. Then she ran, dropping the telescope. *AWOOOOOO!* (“Intruders!”)

Mudrich ran after them.

Ersatzica walked quickly, trying to be quiet as she panicked. All of her siblings were far ahead of her now. She heard several twigs snapping, getting closer. She jumped and ran, fleeing from the sound. The jostling around from her steps unsettled the scar on her stomache. She clutched her belly as she stopped. It threatened to bleed.

She looked back at the source of the noise. The intruders weren’t yet visible. She looked at her belly, just barely holding together. She looked at the drums. She wiped the dust off the tops. “Find the beat, find the beat. I just gotta find the beat.”

She stood up straight. Lifting one foot after another, she beat the drums in sync. “Find the beat.” Soon her feet were stomping at the same rhythm as the drums.

The snapping twigs grew louder and closer.

“Find the beat.” She stepped forward with each stomp. She slowly but surely increased the beat of the drums. She also increased the rate of her steps. “It’s working!” She speed walked towards the stairs.

The snapping twigs were right up on her soon.

“Fast beat! Fast beat!” She pounded the drums as fast as she could. However, her footsteps didn’t get faster. She sped walk as fast as she could, but without the beat. She was just normal speed walking this whole.

*PFFFFT!*

Ersatzica got a face full of dirt and leaves. *AWOOOOOO!* (“Help!”)

The twigs got quieter. Faint silhouettes of cats shifted behind the nearby trees.

Ahead, the staircase was in view, but the landing was still far.

Ersatzica sat up, whimpering, tail curled.

The cats closed in to the nearest trees.

Ersatzica hit the drums. Then again. And again.

The cats paused.

Ersatzica beat them some more, pounding them faster with each beat.

The cats came out from behind the trees. One of the cats whispered, “Monassus?”

“Get him!” Another cat yelled. “Take him alive!”

The cats surrounded Ersatzica, and grabbed her by the arms.

She shifted so the drums fell a bit behind her, and she beat the drums with her tail.

The cat grabbing her left hand launched forward, letting go of her, and splatting against a nearby tree.

“What in the name of Teal—” That cat also got launched into a tree before he could finish what he was saying.

Ersie just kept beating the drum.

“Retreat!” The cats ran away.

Ersie stopped playing the drums.

“Whoa-oh!” Mudrich appeared, face flat on the ground. She got up on all fours to Ersie. “Are you ok?”

Ersie let out her breath. “Muddie!”

“I heard your drums. Did they hurt you?”

Ersie held up her hand. It had a few scratch marks on it, but that was it.”

*AWOOOOO!* (“Help!”) Mudrich howled. “Play the drums.”

“Muddie, I’m fine, let’s go home.”

Muddie jogged in place. “Play the drums.”

*PLOK!*

Muddie felt the spot on her back where something had just hit her.

Wryonin appeared. “Don’t even think about chasing those cats.”

“But they hurt Ersie.”

“And you’ll be hurt more if you chase them.”

“So, we’re just going to let them get away.”

Wryonin tilted his ear towards the cat’s escape path. “Hmmm. Yes.”

“Where’s my telescope?” Lemilay appeared.

Mudrich shrugged. “*You* dropped it.”

“Didn’t you pick it up?”

“No—”

“Did no one pick it up?”

“Why are you asking? You already know the answer.”

“I need it!”

“Well we can help you retrace your steps.” Wryonin offered. “Tomorrow. Tonight it’s just going to be out here.”

“Tomorrow it’s going to be out there.” Ersatzica pointed out into the distance, indicating a location beyond the river.

“What do you mean?”

“One of the cats had it.”

Lemilay’s bald spot glowed and her eyes rolled back for a moment. “The cats *do* have it!”

“Well that sucks, but we can’t go after it tonight.”

“Think about what that *means*, Wryonin. The cats are going to have access to a powerful heirloom that lets them see through walls. Imagine how much *intel* they could gather with it. How that could give them a *tactical* and *strategic* advantage against us.

Wryonin’s tail swished and his eyes narrowed. “You want to risk your hide chasing some dumb heirloom?”

“It’s not dumb!”

“Fine. You three get your hides back to town. I’ll get your stupid telescope back.”

“Hmmph.” Lemilay smiled.

“No way!” Mudrich started dancing. “I’m going with you.”

“Mudrich, quit playing around.”

“They hurt Ersie, I’m going with you.”

“If I hit you, it’s your own fault.”

“Deal. Ersie, drums?”

Ersie scrambled to her feet. She beat the drums as she marched forward. *BUM BUM BUM*

Mudrich showed Wryonin how to sync with the drums, and then Ersie played faster. Mudrich and Wryonin ran off ahead.

Ersie ran as fast as she could without tearing her scar. She heard a lot of commotion ahead that she couldn’t see. Lemilay ran behind her, pushing her pace.

When Ersie and Lemilay got to the beach, multiple cats were laying scattered and bloodied on the beach. Several more were up and about, fighting off Mudrich.

Mudrich was swinging her hammer left and right, keeping the cats at bay. She was moving at normal speed, apparently she had gone out of the range of the drums.

*PLOK!* Another cat were dropped to the ground.

Lemilay emerged from the woods, bald spot active. “There! They’re getting on the boat!” She pointed.

“Ersie!” Mudrich shouted.

“Right!” Ersie beat the drums, syncing up with Mudrich’s swings.

“Got it!”

Ersie sped up the drums, increasing Mudrich’s swing rate.

Mudrich stepped forward, mowing down several cats at once. The remaining cats all backed up, scrambling to get on the boat. The boat had already left, leaving the cats stranded on the shore.

Mudrich made short work of the stranded cats. Her muddy fur coat was now also covered in blood and bits of hair.

“Ok, now find the telescope.”

“You runts!” Lemilay yelled. “You let him get away!”

“Yeah, but look at all those who didn’t. Now you just got to find which one—”

“The one who has my telescope. Is. On. The. Boat.”

“Muck.” Wryonin looked across the river. There was one cat in the boat, almost at the other side. He tilted his ears towards the river.

“Wryonin?”

“Quiet.” Wryonin closed his eyes, raised his slingshot, and let loose a rock. It sailed across the river, landing squarely on the back of the cat’s head. The cat dropped to the ground, tripping over the edge of the boat. “There.”

Lemilay tapped her foot. “So?”

“What?”

“Aren’t you going to go get it?”

“Crossing the river is a suicide mission. The cats will kill any wolves they see on sight. We’ll have the adults get it tomorrow.”

“So you’re not going to go get it?”

“No.”

Lemilay looked at Mudrich.

Mudrich shook her head at Lemilay. “It’s not bath time.”

Lemilay looked at Ersatzica, then rolled her eyes. She growled and stomped her foot.

“Sorry, Lemilay. Now let’s all get home before these cats wake up.”

“But we *need* to get it *tonight*!”

The voices of her siblings faded into the background as Ersatzica tightened the straps on the drums. *Just doggy paddle, just doggy paddle. There’s no shame in not being the best swimmer.* She gave herself a running start, jumping feet-first into the river with a splash.

“Ersatzica!” Wryonin yelled. “What are you doing?”

“I’m going to get the telescope!”

*AWOOOOO!*

The drums helped her float, and she paddled herself across the river, but slowly. The current pulled her along, and she floated out of view of her siblings.

She was almost half way across the river when she heard the sound of the waterfall ahead. She thought she had enough room and enough time to cross, but she didn’t. She would only get about three-quarters of the way there when she would go over the waterfall.

She panicked. She beat the drums. But they didn’t speed her up.

A rock splashed into the ground next to her. A rope attached to it pulled it back up. It splashed down again.

Ersie reached over to grab it, and got a hold of it.

The rope pulled taut, pulling Ersie toward the shore. The cat shore.

She looked up. The rope went straight up towards a rock outcropping, where it vanished. It must have just been a trick of the sunlight, causing it to not be visible.

Ersie was pulled ashore.

“Hey there, are you ok?” A black and white cat reached out a hand.

She scrambled to her feet. She growled at the cat, and ran off. She looked behind her. There was no cat there. She stopped and looked again. The cat she had saw just a moment ago was no longer there. She shivered as she continued.

She very easily found the boat. The cat that escaped laid on the ground, clutching the telescope with its clawed hands. She pulled hard, hard enough to get the telescope back.

The telescope was metal: blue paint with gold trim. It had three telescoping sections that allowed for a lot of adjustments. It was still in good condition. It didn’t seem to get scraped up much from all the commotion. The lenses were still intact, and none of the paint was chipped.

*AWOOOOO!* (“Here!”)

Ersatzica looked up, and across the river. Lemilay was waving her arms at her. Ersatzica waved back. She hopped into the boat and paddled across. This time, she made it to the other side very easily without worrying about the waterfall.

“Give me that.” Lemilay swiped the telescope from Ersatzica’s hands.

“You’re welcome…”

“If you had just restuffed my pillow like I asked, none of this would have happened.”

Ersatzica rolled her eyes.

“Did you encounter any cats?”

“I… I don’t know.”

Lemilay sighed. She flashed her bald spot for a moment. “It appears not.”

Ersatzica froze.

Mudrich waved her hand in front of Ersie. “Are you ok?”

“Muddie, do you believe in ghosts?”

# Chapter 2 – The Boots of Pantrinome

“So what do we tell her?” Wryonin asked Lemilay as hung his utility belt on his bed.

“She’s not coming today, don’t worry.” Lemilay brushed herself off outside the doorway.

“But what about next time we see her?”

“Fine. We’ll just tell her Ersatzica got kidnapped, and that we saved her.”

“But I *didn’t* get kidnapped.”

“They surrounded you. Cats and wolves are both mammals.”

“Well I hope the eye piece was worth it.”

“It will be, don’t worry. Just wait and see.” Lemilay smugly rubbed the telescope. Lemilay hung the brush up on the wall and stepped into the room, tiptoeing to her bed, bunked under Wryonin’s.

“How are you feeling, Ersie?” Mudrich reached up and poked the bottom of Ersie’s top bunk.

“Ow.” Ersie shifted, peeking over the edge at Mudrich. “I’m fine. A little tired, a little wet. But otherwise fine.”

“That’s good. Hey do you wanna see something?”

“Sure. Hold on.” Ersie climbed down and sat on Mudrich’s lower bunk. “What?”

Mudrich sat up cross-legged on her bed. “These.” She grinned from ear to ear, her muzzled jaw wide open.

Two silver circles gleamed in the dim torch light. A blue streak flashed over them.

“Ooh, shiny! What are they?”

“I don’t know. I’ve tried throwing them, biting them, and wearing them as a crown.”

“They’re cuffs.” Wryonin butted in. “They’re meant to be worn on your wrists.”

“Really?” Mudrich put one on, and it slid freely on her arm, then slid off onto the bed. “But they’re too big to be cuffs.”

“You have small wrists.” Wryonin shrugged. “At least compared to whoever they were made for.”

“Well that sucks.” Mudrich sighed. “I can’t wear them!”

“Hold on. I’ve got just the thing.” Ersie reached up to her bed and pulled out a roll of tape from under her pillow.

“You keep tape under your pillow?”

“Sure, never know when you might need some.” Ersie taped the cuffs to Mudrich’s furry arms. “How’s that?”

Mudrich grimaced. “It’s uncomfy.”

“But does it stay?”

Mudrich flung her arms around. “It works!”

“So what do they do?”

“I’m not sure.”

After a few minutes of testing, Mudrich discovered that they grant super strength. “Watch this! I can make the room bigger!” Mudrich punched a hole in the wall.

“Stop!” Lemilay shouted. “You’re getting dust everywhere!”

Mudrich coughed. “It’s just a little.”

“Besides.” Lemilay covered her mouth with her furry arm. “The other side of that wall is the rest of the barracks. Do you really want to share a bedroom with 30 other wolves?”

“Yes?”

“No, no you don’t.”

“Are you sure it leads to the other barracks?” Ersatzica asked. “Muddie punched straight through and… it’s dark in there.”

“Yes, I’m sure.”

“But it’s dark in there, like pitch black.”

“They probably just went to bed already.”

“No, she’s right.” Wryonin’s ears twitched. “I think they’re still awake, playing cards.” Wryonin grabbed the lantern and swung it towards the hole.

Not much could be seen. Just some cobwebs and puddles. A critter scattering about.

“It’s some kind of room.” Wryonin stated.

“It smells really bad.” Mudrich covered her nose.

“Why don’t you two share the bunk tonight? We can get Nephalie to fix it tomorrow.”

“Or…” Mudrich shoved Wryonin out of her bed with ease. “I’ll just move it!” Mudrich picked up the bunk bed and dropped it against the opposite wall with a loud thud. “Done.”

“Ok, but we still need the wall fixed tomorrow.”

“Sure, sure.”

The next day, Lemilay and Wryonin went to do their jobs, leaving Mudrich and Ersatzica to fetch Nephalie.

“What if we, instead…”

“Muddie, no.”

“But what if we find something good in there?”

“What if we find something horrible in there? It smells like something *died* in there.”

“Let’s find out!”

“No!”

“Come on, Ersie. Can you speed me up?”

“Ok.” Ersatzica beat on the drums, pounding more rapidly as Mudrich synced herself up.

Muddie punched the wall, and again. In rhythm with the drums.

BUM BUM BUM

POUND POUND POUND

Muddie punched the last brick with extra fervor, sending it flying into the room. Ersie handed her the lantern as they both entered. Ersatzica taped her nose and Mudrich’s nose.

Inside, they found a few dead rat corpses, and the floor was littered in rat feces. Cob webs decorated every corner. A puddle or two reflected the lantern light.

Ersie gasped.

In one corner, a cot was rusting away. On top of it laid a blood-stained skeleton.

“Ersie look!”

“I see it.” She approached the cot.

What sort of poor soul had lost their life here? Had been sealed up? And why? How awful it must have been to lay here and be forgotten about.

The skull had a muzzle that was too short to be a wolf’s. This must’ve been a cat. The skeleton was devoid of any clothing, except for the feet. Over the feet were a pair of boots.

They were hard to see in the dim light, but they were red and gold-plated. Intricate mechanics filled up the internals near the heels. They were in dire need of repair.

A blue streak flashed over the boots.

“Don’t worry.” She whispered to the skeleton. “Whoever you were, I’m here now. And I’ll take good care of you.”

“Are you talking to the skeleton?”

“Muddie, go fetch Nephalie.”

“Aww, alright.”

Ersatzica turned back to the skeleton, and the boots.

The boots had two latches each. She held the boots in place as she unlatched them, one by one. The mouth of the boots opened up, and she gently slid the boots off.

They were covered in soot, dust, and cobwebs. She dusted them off by hand, then fetched Lemilay’s brush from the wall to get in the crevices. Despite that, they were still dirty, and quite a bit rusty.

“Don’t worry, I got you.” She smuggled them out of the room and hid them under Muddy’s bed.

When Nephalie arrived with Mudrich, she was quite disgusted. “You pups really out did yourself this time, huh?” The deer girl walked in, rubbing her hoof hands together. “Might as well punch down the whole building while you’re at it.”

“Can you fix it?”

“You didn’t even try to rebuild it yourself! Where are all the bricks at? Do you expect me to move them myself?”

“That’s your job, right?” Mudrich contested.

“Mudrich. You did this, you help.” Nephalie pointed to all the bricks. “Move them.”

“Ok, I’m doing it. Don’t have to be so mean.”

“And you don’t have to be so careless.”

Mudrich piled the bricks up near the hole.

Nephalie rolled her eyes. “That’s not neat enough, but…” She flexed her hoof hands. “I guess it’s good enough for me to work my magic.”

Mudrich bounced up and down. “This is my favorite part.”

Nephalie placed her hoof hands over the bricks, middle finger separated. The hoof on the end of her middle finger grew rapidly. The bricks morphed and stretched, growing up from the floor to fill in the hole in the wall. The result looked like a someone stretched out a white blob of goo and let it dry. Ugly, but functional.

Nephalie tapped the wall with her middle hoof fingers, breaking off the excess hoof. She handed both hoof clippings to Mudrich. “Keep these safe. Remember to get it fixed properly.”

Mudrich wagged her tail as she accepted the hoof clippings. “Thank you, Neffie.”

“It’s Nephalie. And next time this happens, don’t break the wall.” She left.

Mudrich handed Ersatzica the hoof clippings. She moved the bed back to where it had been. Then she helped carry the boots to Ersie’s workshop.

“So what do you think these boots do?”

“Well before we test, I need to clean them up first. I don’t even know if we can put them on to find out.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well for one, they might be too rusty to slip into. There’s also size. You have to be sure you have a matching shoe size. And the big one: they’re cat boots.”

“Of course they are. You don’t see wolves wearing boots.”

“But that means we wolves might not be able to use them.”

“Well, you can change that, can’t you? Make the cat boots into wolf boots?”

“Well, no, I can’t… unless I adjust the distance between the… and I also change the size of the sole… Yeah, actually! I can.”

“Then do it! I want to test them out!”

“Hold on Muddie! It’s going to take a while. They probably won’t be ready today.”

“Ok.” Muddie left Ersatzica to her work.

Ersatzica sat her next patient onto her desk.
