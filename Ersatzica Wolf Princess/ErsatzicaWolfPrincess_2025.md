# Chapter 1 – The Drums of Retriyoan

A slender, black-and-white wolf girl inspected her patient on the worktable. It was a leather belt with scratches in one particular place that eventually cut all the way through. Attached to it were several items of use to their owner: a bag of rocks, a knife in its sheath, a bladder, and a wooden slingshot.

The wolf girl looked around her workshop. It was a comfortable organized chaos, full of past projects, tools, plans, and materials. She opened a cupboard of dried skins and pulled out a sheet.

Taking out her trusty screwdriver, she sliced the leather, cutting off a thin strip. She sprawled the belt flat across her worktable and laid the strip on top of it. She sewed it together, over the course of a half hour, making the belt as good as new.

The owner wasn’t here to test it out, so she tried it on herself. She dug her paws into the bag of rocks and easily pulled out one. Check. She unsheathed and sheathed the knife. Check. She took out the bladder, pretended to drink from it, and put it back. Check. She unholstered the slingshot and tried to re-holster it, but a wooden spike on the slingshot scraped across the belt. Uncheck.

She placed the culprit on the worktable, leaning over it. “I want to saw this spike off, but he told me not to.” She contemplated it, and finally decided to search for her sawblade. “If I don’t, he’ll wear a cut into his belt again.” She sawed the spike off and filed the rough edges off with her screwdriver.

She holstered the slingshot onto the belt. Check.

*KNOCK KNOCK*

“Ersie, can I come in?”

Ersie took off the belt she had just finished repairing. “Come in.”

The door burst open, releasing a short, all-white wolf girl. She ran up to Ersie, bouncing up and down, dried mud patches flopping to the ground. “Did you finish it? Did you did you?”

“Calm down, Muddy.” Ersie pushed her back. “It’s right here.” She pulled out a metal hammer from a barrel that was about as big as the white wolf girl was.

Muddy grabbed it and swung it. “This feels great!” She hit the door, knocking the locking mechanism askew.

“Not in here!”

“Oh, right. Sorry, Ersie.”

“Now, you need to take better care of it. I managed to scrape off all the rust spots, and I added a coat of sealant to make it water resistant, but you have to keep it indoors.”

“But then how will I know where I left off with my tunnel progress?”

“That’s what this is for.” Ersie handed her a stake with a stitched-together cloth attached to the end.

“Oh! This is wonderful!” Muddy stuck it in the cracks between the stones that made up the floor.

“I’m glad you like it. I made it out of scraps from my workbench.”

“Thanks so much, Ersie!” Muddy gave Ersie a big squeezer hug.

“No problem, Muddy.” Ersie tapped her.

Muddy let her go. “Do you want to come help me with a new hole?”

“Not today, Muddy. I got stuff to do.”

“Ok, see you later!” Muddy ran out.

Ersie got to work on the next project: two identical drums. They had once been attached together by a belt, but that belt had since worn away. The drums were painted red with a gold trim, and had impeccable craftsmanship. A blue glint shimmered across the drums. Ersie felt a closeness to them that she couldn’t explain, like the drums were welcoming her to work on them.

“Ersatzica?”

“Come in.”

A black and grey wolf boy pushed the workshop door open and marched inside. “How’s it coming?”

Ersatzica looked up at him as she handed him the belt. “I fixed your belt, like you asked. I stitched it up, good as new, it should last a lot longer now.”

Wryonin wrapped the belt around his waist and felt around for the items. “Where’s the slingshot?”

“Now, don’t be mad, but…”

“Ersatzica, what did you do?”

She held the slingshot behind her back. “Your belt could break again, and what if it happened while fighting the cats?”

“Please don’t tell me you did what I think you did.”

“And you cut yourself all the time by accident. And… and you don’t even look at your slingshot while shooting it, so…”

“Ersatzica, hand me my slingshot.”

“Promise not to get mad?”

“Give it to me.” He reached behind her to grab it.

“Promise?”

He grabbed it and pulled it out of her hand. Inspecting it, he found it lacking a particular spike. “Ersatzica! This was grandfather’s! He carved it with his own paws! And you went and destroyed it.” He mimed shooting it. “How am I supposed to aim now?” He mimed throwing it on the ground, but nevertheless holstered it. “Thanks a lot.” He stormed off.

Ersatzica leaned over her workshop, tears welling up in her eyes. She picked up her screwdriver and slowly fiddled with an adjustment knob on the drums, but then dropped the screwdriver.

“Ha! I knew it!”

Ersatzica sucked in her tears and turned around.

A grey and white wolf walked in, eyes rolled back into her skull. A white bald spot on her forehead glowed enough illuminate the scene. “I told you so! I knew he would get mad.”

“What do you want, Lemilay?”

Lemilay rolled her eyes forward, dimming out her bald spot. “My throne is getting uncomfy. It needs some more stuffing.”

“I just put more quills in your pillow last week.”

“Well, it needs some more.” Lemilay brushed aside the drums and set her “throne” pillow onto Ersatzica’s workbench in their wake. “Bye for now, I’ll be back after dinner.”

“I’ll have it done by tomorrow.”

“Hmmm.” Lemilay lifted her chin at Ersatzica. “Very well. I graciously grant you a deadline extension.” She swiped Ersatzica’s chin with the tip of her tail. With a glowing bald spot, she added, “I see Mudrich broke your door again. Better get that fixed.” She didn’t even bother to close the door as she left.

Ersatzica stewed on her stool for a minute, and then got to work on the pillows. They were plenty puffy, they just seemed flat after hours of being sat on. She fluffed them out without even using her tools. For good measure, she straightened the fur grain on the top.

Ersatzica then pushed the pillow aside to make room for the drums. She cut out a strip of leather to fit around her own waist and laid out the drums along it, meticulously calculating where best to put them. She placed them right next to each on the front. Then she attached them to the belt.

Putting the belt on, she immediately realized a problem: the drums sagged forward, causing the whole belt to droop. Uncheck.

Well why had this not happened with Wryonin’s belt? There was nothing on it that was that heavy. Wait, yeah there was. The bag of rocks, and the bladder. So why did that work, but this doesn’t?

Ersatzica took out a piece of paper and a pencil, sketching out her memory of Wryonin’s utility belt. She soon discovered that the heavy items were on opposite sides of the belt, balancing it out.

Aha!

With that in mind, Ersatzica detached the drums and laid them out so they were on either side of the belt. Her stomach rumbled as she sewed them back on.

Putting the belt back on, she found that the belt didn’t droop as much. Check! But the drums still didn’t seem to be attached properly. Uncheck.

Her stomach rumbled.

She pressed on, taking the belt off and preparing to detach the drums again.

“Ersie! Help!” Mudrich burst through the door.

“What’s wrong, Muddy?”

“My stake is broken!”

“How that happen?”

“I was trying to pound it into the ground, but when I hit it with my hammer, it just snapped instead.”

“Oh, Muddy, you weren’t supposed to pound it with your hammer.”

“I wasn’t?”

“No, you were supposed to…”

Ersie’s stomach growled.

“Ersie! Did you skip dinner again?”

“I had a snack earlier.”

“You mean leather and wood chips?”

“Maybe?”

“Come on, Ersie, let’s go eat.”

They were a bit late to the mess hall. Most wolves were already finished eating and tossing their leftover bones onto the bone pile. Ersie helped herself to some of the leftovers, taking it with her.

Muddie looked up from picking through the bone pile. “Where you going?”

“Back to my workshop.”

“But it’s such a nice day out! Let’s go down to the river.”

“But I don’t want to eat where it’s wet.”

“Just eat on the way. Come on!”

Ersie followed Muddie to the river, eating her rations as she went. She finished well before they walked down the cliff stairs, through the forest, and to the river. She left a trail of bones as she went.

“So why the river?”

“I want to show you something.”

Muddie led her to big rock by the river, so close it was literally part of the river bank. The river roared up next to the boulder, threatening to swallow it up.

“It’s a boulder.”

“Not just any boulder!” Muddie tapped the boulder gently with her hammer. *TING TING*. “See?”

“That’s just the noise boulders make.”

“No, it’s not!” Muddie insisted. “I think there’s something inside it.”

“Like what?”

“I don’t know, minerals maybe?”

“Well if it did, why hasn’t it been mined yet?”

“Because it’s been buried under a hole bunch of dirt, until recently.” Muddie jumped onto the boulder island. “The river and I have done a fine job of finding it.” Muddie danced on the boulder.

Ersie, with the drums still attached to her side, banged on them. *BUM BUM BUM*

“Oh yeah!” Muddie danced to the music.

Muddie danced to the beat of Ersie’s drums .

“Whoa!” Muddie’s eyes went wide. “Did you feel that?”

“No, what happened?” *BUM BUM BUM*

“I’m not sure.” Muddie let her hands relax and her feet rest, but they didn’t want to. “Hey! Hey! Hey!”

“What’s wrong Muddie?”

“Stop playing the drums!”

*BUM BUM—*

“Whew!” Muddie took a deep breath. “That was intense.”

“It was?”

Muddie took another breath. “Alright, let’s go again. I think I have an idea how this heirloom works.”

*BUM BUM BUM*

Muddie danced to the beat of the drum.

“Faster.”

*BUM BUM BUM*

Muddie’s dancing increased in speed. “Faster.”

*BUM BUM BUM*

Muddie danced in a frenzy, moving at speeds that seemed impossible.

Ersie sped up the drums.

Muddie became a blur.

“Muddie, you good?”

She didn’t respond.

*BUM BUM—*

“Ah!” Muddie exclaimed. “Finally!” She knelt down and took a deep breath.

“How were you moving so fast?”

“It’s… the drums…” Muddie caught her breath. “You try.”

Ersie did a little jig with her feet.

*BUM BUM BUM*

She sped up the drums.

*BUM BUM BUM*

She increased the tempo again.

*BUM BUM BUM*

Her feet were still moving like normal. “Nothing’s happening.”

“You’re doing it wrong.”

“Are you sure? I’m doing exactly what you were doing.”

“No I was moving my arms. You know, the standard dance we do. You were just standing there like a tree.”

“Well I can’t move my arms and play the drums at the same time.”

“Ok I wanna try again.”

Ersie stopped dancing and focused on the drums.

*BUM BUM BUM*

“Muddie, you’re not dancing.”

“I’m trying something else.” She jogged in place, feet timed to the beat and arms pumping to the tempo.

*BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM*

“Ok now faster.”

Ersie gradually sped up the drums.

Muddie’s pace quickened as she jogged. Her legs soon became a blur.

*BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM*

Ersie blinked, and Muddie was gone. A huge gust of wind blew past her, leaving a trail of trampled leaves and muddy pawprints.

“Muddie?”

Ersie looked around, but there was no sign of Muddie.

*AWOOOO*. (“Here!”) Ersie howled.

*AWOOOO.* (“Here!”) Mudrich howled back. A minute later, she appeared from the woods, running at top speed. She was covered in mud from head to toe. Well, more than usual.

“What happened to you?”

“The most amazing thing ever, Ersie!”

“A fresh pile of mud?”

“I ran so fast with those drums!” Muddie got on all fours.

“Mudrich! Not here!”

Mudrich shook all the loose mud off here, splashing it all over Ersie and the drums.

“Oh, sorry Ersie.” She picked up her hammer. “Let’s try again.”

They tried the drums out on Mudrich’s hammer, finding that she can swing faster while under the influence of the drums. They tried other things, finding that it sped up Mudrich as long as she was synced to the beat first.

Ersie tried to get the same effect, but no matter what she did, she couldn’t get it to work.

Mudrich shrugged. “Maybe you’re just bad. I’ve got the beat.”

“No, I’m good at getting the beat too. It must be something else.”

“No you just suck, admit it.”

Ersie’s ears folded back. She slowed down the beat of the drums as Mudrich dug to the beat. She slowed the beat down to the starting beat, then further slower to about half as fast.

“Hey! What gives?” Mudrich shouted.

“What?”

“Why can’t I move any faster?”

Ersie stopped playing.

Mudrich let out an exasperated sigh. “Finally!” She dug some more. “Hey, who turned off the beat?”

“Mudrich.”

“It wasn’t me.”

“No, Mudrich!”

“Huh? Oh… oh!” Mudrich slapped herself in the forehead. “Of course! If it can speed me up, it can also slow me down. But why would I want that?”

“That’s what I want to ask Ersatzica.”

“Lemilay!” Ersatzica turned to her sister, who quietly approached. “What are you doing down here?”

“I’m not *afraid* of mud, you know.” Lemilay wiped her fur to brush some mud off. “And you also know *that* is not what I asked for.” She pointed up to the village.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“You know full well what I’m talking about. I asked you to—”

“Lemlem, check out what I can do!” Mudrich interjected, doing a quick jig.

“Brilliant.” Lemilay scoffed.

“Come on, Ersie, show her.”

Lemilay flashed her bald spot, her eyes rolling back into her skull. A second later, she returned to normal.

“Did you see it? Wasn’t it cool?”

“Great. So you two were down here partying instead of getting your job done? Wait until Mother hears about this.”

“Lemilay, don’t!” Ersatzica grabbed her by the arm. “I’ll get it done.”

Lemilay crossed her arms. “Ok, but I expect extra fluff.”

“Ok.”

“Lemilay! Did you see the jig! Did you see how quick—”

“I saw your damn jig, Mudrich!” Lemilay shouted.

“Well you don’t have to shout at me.”

“Well you don’t have to be so annoying.”

“But you should see it.”

“I *saw* it Mudrich. It’s just another stupid heirloom.”

“It’s not stupid.” Ersatzica’s ears pinned back.

“Can it repair my cushion? Can it tell the time? Can it keep people in line?”

“Hey that rhymed.”

“Shut up Mudrich.”

“No, but it can—”

“Then who cares? You two have fun with it, but only after getting your jobs done.”

“What’s going on?” Wryonin dropped down from a tree.

“Nothing, go away.”

“I heard shouting. I thought you were in trouble.”

“We’re fine.”

“You shouldn’t be out here this late. The cats—”

“Wryonin check this out!” Mudrich did her jig. “Come on, Ersie, show him.”

Ersie looked away.

“Come on, Ersie?”

Ersie mumbled, “Not right now, Muddie.”

“As I was saying, the cats have taken the area on the other side of the river. Meaning this area is surely next on their agenda.”

“Wryonin, we’re fine.” Lemilay walked away.

“Wait, we should all walk together.”

“We should *jig* together, right Ersie?”

Ersie followed her siblings, not saying anything.

“Everyone stop.” Wryonin froze.

Mudrich pretended to be a statue, standing on one leg. Ersatzica laid her hands on the drums as she stopped. Lemilay kept walking.

Wryonin’s ears twitched. “They’re here! Everyone run!” Wryonin took off toward the stairs. *AWOOOOO!* (“Intruders!”)

“It was probably just a twig.” Lemilay pulled out a telescope. She looked into it, then froze.

“Lemlem?”

Lemilay twitched. Then she ran, dropping the telescope. *AWOOOOOO!* (“Intruders!”)

Mudrich ran after them.

Ersatzica walked quickly, trying to be quiet as she panicked. All of her siblings were far ahead of her now. She heard several twigs snapping, getting closer. She jumped and ran, fleeing from the sound. The jostling around from her steps unsettled the scar on her stomache. She clutched her belly as she stopped. It threatened to bleed.

She looked back at the source of the noise. The intruders weren’t yet visible. She looked at her belly, just barely holding together. She looked at the drums. She wiped the dust off the tops. “Find the beat, find the beat. I just gotta find the beat.”

She stood up straight. Lifting one foot after another, she beat the drums in sync. “Find the beat.” Soon her feet were stomping at the same rhythm as the drums.

The snapping twigs grew louder and closer.

“Find the beat.” She stepped forward with each stomp. She slowly but surely increased the beat of the drums. She also increased the rate of her steps. “It’s working!” She speed walked towards the stairs.

The snapping twigs were right up on her soon.

“Fast beat! Fast beat!” She pounded the drums as fast as she could. However, her footsteps didn’t get faster. She sped walk as fast as she could, but without the beat. She was just normal speed walking this whole.

*PFFFFT!*

Ersatzica got a face full of dirt and leaves. *AWOOOOOO!* (“Help!”)

The twigs got quieter. Faint silhouettes of cats shifted behind the nearby trees.

Ahead, the staircase was in view, but the landing was still far.

Ersatzica sat up, whimpering, tail curled.

The cats closed in to the nearest trees.

Ersatzica hit the drums. Then again. And again.

The cats paused.

Ersatzica beat them some more, pounding them faster with each beat.

The cats came out from behind the trees. One of the cats whispered, “Monassus?”

“Get him!” Another cat yelled. “Take him alive!”

The cats surrounded Ersatzica, and grabbed her by the arms.

She shifted so the drums fell a bit behind her, and she beat the drums with her tail.

The cat grabbing her left hand launched forward, letting go of her, and splatting against a nearby tree.

“What in the name of Teal—” That cat also got launched into a tree before he could finish what he was saying.

Ersie just kept beating the drum.

“Retreat!” The cats ran away.

Ersie stopped playing the drums.

“Whoa-oh!” Mudrich appeared, face flat on the ground. She got up on all fours to Ersie. “Are you ok?”

Ersie let out her breath. “Muddie!”

“I heard your drums. Did they hurt you?”

Ersie held up her hand. It had a few scratch marks on it, but that was it.”

*AWOOOOO!* (“Help!”) Mudrich howled. “Play the drums.”

“Muddie, I’m fine, let’s go home.”

Muddie jogged in place. “Play the drums.”

*PLOK!*

Muddie felt the spot on her back where something had just hit her.

Wryonin appeared. “Don’t even think about chasing those cats.”

“But they hurt Ersie.”

“And you’ll be hurt more if you chase them.”

“So, we’re just going to let them get away.”

Wryonin tilted his ear towards the cat’s escape path. “Hmmm. Yes.”

“Where’s my telescope?” Lemilay appeared.

Mudrich shrugged. “*You* dropped it.”

“Didn’t you pick it up?”

“No—”

“Did no one pick it up?”

“Why are you asking? You already know the answer.”

“I need it!”

“Well we can help you retrace your steps.” Wryonin offered. “Tomorrow. Tonight it’s just going to be out here.”

“Tomorrow it’s going to be out there.” Ersatzica pointed out into the distance, indicating a location beyond the river.

“What do you mean?”

“One of the cats had it.”

Lemilay’s bald spot glowed and her eyes rolled back for a moment. “The cats *do* have it!”

“Well that sucks, but we can’t go after it tonight.”

“Think about what that *means*, Wryonin. The cats are going to have access to a powerful heirloom that lets them see through walls. Imagine how much *intel* they could gather with it. How that could give them a *tactical* and *strategic* advantage against us.

Wryonin’s tail swished and his eyes narrowed. “You want to risk your hide chasing some dumb heirloom?”

“It’s not dumb!”

“Fine. You three get your hides back to town. I’ll get your stupid telescope back.”

“Hmmph.” Lemilay smiled.

“No way!” Mudrich started dancing. “I’m going with you.”

“Mudrich, quit playing around.”

“They hurt Ersie, I’m going with you.”

“If I hit you, it’s your own fault.”

“Deal. Ersie, drums?”

Ersie scrambled to her feet. She beat the drums as she marched forward. *BUM BUM BUM*

Mudrich showed Wryonin how to sync with the drums, and then Ersie played faster. Mudrich and Wryonin ran off ahead.

Ersie ran as fast as she could without tearing her scar. She heard a lot of commotion ahead that she couldn’t see. Lemilay ran behind her, pushing her pace.

When Ersie and Lemilay got to the beach, multiple cats were laying scattered and bloodied on the beach. Several more were up and about, fighting off Mudrich.

Mudrich was swinging her hammer left and right, keeping the cats at bay. She was moving at normal speed, apparently she had gone out of the range of the drums.

*PLOK!* Another cat were dropped to the ground.

Lemilay emerged from the woods, bald spot active. “There! They’re getting on the boat!” She pointed.

“Ersie!” Mudrich shouted.

“Right!” Ersie beat the drums, syncing up with Mudrich’s swings.

“Got it!”

Ersie sped up the drums, increasing Mudrich’s swing rate.

Mudrich stepped forward, mowing down several cats at once. The remaining cats all backed up, scrambling to get on the boat. The boat had already left, leaving the cats stranded on the shore.

Mudrich made short work of the stranded cats. Her muddy fur coat was now also covered in blood and bits of hair.

“Ok, now find the telescope.”

“You runts!” Lemilay yelled. “You let him get away!”

“Yeah, but look at all those who didn’t. Now you just got to find which one—”

“The one who has my telescope. Is. On. The. Boat.”

“Muck.” Wryonin looked across the river. There was one cat in the boat, almost at the other side. He tilted his ears towards the river.

“Wryonin?”

“Quiet.” Wryonin closed his eyes, raised his slingshot, and let loose a rock. It sailed across the river, landing squarely on the back of the cat’s head. The cat dropped to the ground, tripping over the edge of the boat. “There.”

Lemilay tapped her foot. “So?”

“What?”

“Aren’t you going to go get it?”

“Crossing the river is a suicide mission. The cats will kill any wolves they see on sight. We’ll have the adults get it tomorrow.”

“So you’re not going to go get it?”

“No.”

Lemilay looked at Mudrich.

Mudrich shook her head at Lemilay. “It’s not bath time.”

Lemilay looked at Ersatzica, then rolled her eyes. She growled and stomped her foot.

“Sorry, Lemilay. Now let’s all get home before these cats wake up.”

“But we *need* to get it *tonight*!”

The voices of her siblings faded into the background as Ersatzica tightened the straps on the drums. *Just doggy paddle, just doggy paddle. There’s no shame in not being the best swimmer.* She gave herself a running start, jumping feet-first into the river with a splash.

“Ersatzica!” Wryonin yelled. “What are you doing?”

“I’m going to get the telescope!”

*AWOOOOO!*

The drums helped her float, and she paddled herself across the river, but slowly. The current pulled her along, and she floated out of view of her siblings.

She was almost half way across the river when she heard the sound of the waterfall ahead. She thought she had enough room and enough time to cross, but she didn’t. She would only get about three-quarters of the way there when she would go over the waterfall.

She panicked. She beat the drums. But they didn’t speed her up.

A rock splashed into the ground next to her. A rope attached to it pulled it back up. It splashed down again.

Ersie reached over to grab it, and got a hold of it.

The rope pulled taut, pulling Ersie toward the shore. The cat shore.

She looked up. The rope went straight up towards a rock outcropping, where it vanished. It must have just been a trick of the sunlight, causing it to not be visible.

Ersie was pulled ashore.

“Hey there, are you ok?” A black and white cat reached out a hand.

She scrambled to her feet. She growled at the cat, and ran off. She looked behind her. There was no cat there. She stopped and looked again. The cat she had saw just a moment ago was no longer there. She shivered as she continued.

She very easily found the boat. The cat that escaped laid on the ground, clutching the telescope with its clawed hands. She pulled hard, hard enough to get the telescope back.

The telescope was metal: blue paint with gold trim. It had three telescoping sections that allowed for a lot of adjustments. It was still in good condition. It didn’t seem to get scraped up much from all the commotion. The lenses were still intact, and none of the paint was chipped.

*AWOOOOO!* (“Here!”)

Ersatzica looked up, and across the river. Lemilay was waving her arms at her. Ersatzica waved back. She hopped into the boat and paddled across. This time, she made it to the other side very easily without worrying about the waterfall.

“Give me that.” Lemilay swiped the telescope from Ersatzica’s hands.

“You’re welcome…”

“If you had just restuffed my pillow like I asked, none of this would have happened.”

Ersatzica rolled her eyes.

“Did you encounter any cats?”

“I… I don’t know.”

Lemilay sighed. She flashed her bald spot for a moment. “It appears not.”

Ersatzica froze.

Mudrich waved her hand in front of Ersie. “Are you ok?”

“Muddie, do you believe in ghosts?”

# Chapter 3 – The Boots of Pantrinome

“So what do we tell her?” Wryonin asked Lemilay as hung his utility belt on his bed.

“She’s not coming today, don’t worry.” Lemilay brushed herself off outside the doorway.

“But what about next time we see her?”

“Fine. We’ll just tell her Ersatzica got kidnapped, and that we saved her.”

“But I *didn’t* get kidnapped.”

“They surrounded you. Cats and wolves are both mammals.”

“Well I hope the eye piece was worth it.”

“It will be, don’t worry. Just wait and see.” Lemilay smugly rubbed the telescope. Lemilay hung the brush up on the wall and stepped into the room, tiptoeing to her bed, bunked under Wryonin’s.

“How are you feeling, Ersie?” Mudrich reached up and poked the bottom of Ersie’s top bunk.

“Ow.” Ersie shifted, peeking over the edge at Mudrich. “I’m fine. A little tired, a little wet. But otherwise fine.”

“That’s good. Hey do you wanna see something?”

“Sure. Hold on.” Ersie climbed down and sat on Mudrich’s lower bunk. “What?”

Mudrich sat up cross-legged on her bed. “These.” She grinned from ear to ear, her jaw wide open.

Two silver circular bands gleamed in the dim torch light. A blue streak flashed over them.

“Ooh, shiny! What are they?”

“I don’t know. I’ve tried throwing them, biting them, and wearing them as a crown.”

“They’re cuffs.” Wryonin butted in. “They’re meant to be worn on your wrists.”

“Really?” Mudrich put one on, and it slid freely on her arm, then slid off onto the bed. “But they’re too big to be cuffs.”

“You have small wrists.” Wryonin shrugged. “At least compared to whoever they were made for.”

“Well that sucks.” Mudrich sighed. “I can’t wear them!”

“Hold on. I’ve got just the thing.” Ersie reached up to her bed and pulled out a roll of tape from under her pillow.

“You keep tape under your pillow?”

“Sure, never know when you might need some.” Ersie taped the cuffs to Mudrich’s furry arms. “How’s that?”

Mudrich grimaced. “It’s uncomfy.”

“But does it stay?”

Mudrich flung her arms around. “It works!”

“So what do they do?”

“I’m not sure.” Mudrich said.

After a few minutes of testing, Mudrich discovered that they grant super strength. “Watch this! I can make the room bigger!” Mudrich punched a hole in the wall.

“Stop!” Lemilay shouted. “You’re getting dust everywhere!”

Mudrich coughed. “It’s just a little.”

“Besides.” Lemilay covered her mouth with her furry arm. “The other side of that wall is the rest of the barracks. Do you really want to share a bedroom with 30 other wolves?”

“Yes?”

“No, no you don’t.”

“Are you sure it leads to the other barracks?” Ersatzica asked. “Muddie punched straight through and… it’s dark in there.”

“Yes, I’m sure.”

“But it’s dark in there, like pitch black.”

“They probably just went to bed already.”

“No, she’s right.” Wryonin’s ears twitched. “I think they’re still awake, playing cards.” Wryonin grabbed the lantern and swung it towards the hole.

Not much could be seen. Just some cobwebs and puddles. A critter scattering about.

“It’s some kind of room.” Wryonin stated.

“It smells really bad.” Mudrich covered her nose.

“Why don’t you two share the bunk tonight? We can get Nephalie to fix it tomorrow.”

“Or…” Mudrich shoved Wryonin out of her bed with ease. “I’ll just move it!” Mudrich picked up the bunk bed and dropped it against the opposite wall with a loud thud. “Done.”

“Ok, but we still need the wall fixed tomorrow.”

“Sure, sure.”

The next day, Lemilay and Wryonin went to do their jobs, leaving Mudrich and Ersatzica to fetch Nephalie.

“What if we, instead…” Mudrich said.

“Muddie, no.”

“But what if we find something good in there?”

“What if we find something horrible in there? It smells like something *died* in there.”

“Let’s find out!”

“No!”

“Come on, Ersie. Can you speed me up?”

“Ok.” Ersatzica beat on the drums, pounding more rapidly as Mudrich synced herself up.

Muddie punched the wall, and again. In rhythm with the drums.

BUM BUM BUM

POUND POUND POUND

Muddie punched the last brick with extra fervor, sending it flying into the room. Ersie handed her the lantern as they both entered. Ersatzica taped her nose and Mudrich’s nose shut.

[cloth or clothe pin instead of tape?]

Inside, they found a few dead rat corpses, and the floor was littered in rat feces. Cob webs decorated every corner. A puddle or two reflected the lantern light.

Ersie gasped.

In one corner, a cot was rusting away. On top of it laid a blood-stained skeleton.

“Ersie look!”

“I see it.” She approached the cot.

What sort of poor soul had lost their life here? Had been sealed up? And why? How awful it must have been to lay here and be forgotten about.

The skull had a muzzle that was too short to be a wolf’s. This must’ve been a cat. The skeleton was devoid of any clothing, except for the feet. Over the feet were a pair of boots.

They were hard to see in the dim light, but they were red and gold-plated. Intricate mechanics filled up the internals near the heels. They were in dire need of repair.

A blue streak flashed over the boots.

“Don’t worry.” She whispered to the blue streak in the boots. “Whoever you were, I’m here now. And I’ll take good care of you.”

“Are you talking to the skeleton?”

“Muddie, go fetch Nephalie.”

“Aww, alright.”

Ersatzica turned back to the skeleton, and the boots.

The boots had two latches each. She held the boots in place as she unlatched them, one by one. The mouth of the boots opened up, and she gently slid the boots off.

They were covered in soot, dust, and cobwebs. She brought them into the bedroom, dusting them off by hand, then fetched Lemilay’s brush from the wall to get in the crevices. Despite that, they were still dirty, and quite a bit rusty.

“Don’t worry, I got you.” She hid them under Muddy’s bed.

When Nephalie arrived with Mudrich, she was quite disgusted. “You pups really out did yourself this time, huh?” The deer girl walked in, rubbing her hoof hands together. “Might as well punch down the whole building while you’re at it.”

“Can you fix it?”

“You didn’t even try to rebuild it yourself! Where are all the bricks at? Do you expect me to move them myself?”

“That’s your job, right?” Mudrich contested, holding her nose.

“Mudrich. You did this, you help.” Nephalie pointed to all the bricks. “Move them.”

“Ok, I’m doing it. Don’t have to be so mean.”

“And you don’t have to be so careless.”

Mudrich piled the bricks up near the hole.

Nephalie rolled her eyes. “That’s not neat enough, but…” She flexed her hoof hands. “I guess it’s good enough for me to work my magic.”

Mudrich bounced up and down. “This is my favorite part.”

Nephalie placed her hoof hands over the bricks, middle finger separated. The hoof on the end of her middle finger grew rapidly. The bricks morphed and stretched, growing up from the floor to fill in the hole in the wall. The result looked like a someone stretched out a white blob of goo and let it dry. Ugly, but functional.

Nephalie tapped the wall with her middle hoof fingers, breaking off the excess hoof. She handed both hoof clippings to Mudrich. “Keep these safe. Remember to get it fixed properly.”

Mudrich wagged her tail as she accepted the hoof clippings. “Thank you, Neffie.”

“It’s Nephalie. And don’t do this again, *please*.” She left.

Mudrich handed Ersatzica the hoof clippings. She moved the bed back to where it had been. Then she carried the boots to Ersie’s workshop.

“So what do you think these boots do?” Mudrich said.

“Well before we test, I need to clean them up first. I don’t even know if we can put them on to find out.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well for one, they might be too rusty to slip into. There’s also size. You have to be sure you have a matching shoe size. And the big one: they’re cat boots.”

“Of course they are. You don’t see wolves wearing boots.”

“But that means we wolves might not be able to use them.”

“Well, you can change that, can’t you? Make the cat boots into wolf boots?”

“Well, no, I can’t… unless I adjust the distance between the… and I also change the size of the sole… Yeah, actually! I can.”

“Then do it! I want to test them out!”

“Hold on Muddie! It’s going to take a while. They probably won’t be ready today.”

“Ok.” Muddie pushed open the door to Ersie’s workshop, then set the boots down on her desk. “See you in a muddy!”

“It’ll be longer than a muddy.”

“Ok, see you in an ersie!”

“Bye, Muddy.”

The boots had been sitting in a cool, dry place for a very, very long time. They were covered in, and filled with, dust. Ersie gently tapped them in in various directions to get the dust out. She wiped down every surface she could, making sure to keep her nose strapped shut. Still, she sneezed a few times, necessitating opening the window.

[straps vs tape, dusty boots have no color]

Finally she was able to see what she was dealing with: Red metal imperial boots with gold plating. It had patches where the paint had been chewed down. It was very mechanical for a pair of boots: a spring from the heel to the sole, gears in the middle, and a sliding mechanism that separated the rest of the boot from the ground. It was very stubborn in moving, making it difficult to tell what the mechanism was for. But that wasn’t anything a little oil couldn’t fix.

After a good oiling, scrubbing, and polishing, the boots sparkled like new. Even the missing paint splotches looked fantastic, gave it character.

A blue streak flashed across the boots for but a moment.

“Happy now? You’re looking so much better!” Ersatzica gave the boots a few wolf kisses, polishing the boots with the resulting saliva afterwards.

The boots were very enticing. The best part of refurbishing an heirloom was always getting to try it out, to see what it could do. Even the disappointing effects were interesting. But without being able to fit into them, there didn’t seem to be a way to test them out.

*KNOCK KNOCK*

“Come in.” Ersatzica said, not taking her attention from the boots.

“Erse’, it break again.”

Ersatzica turned around. It was Tormael, the town chef. He stood just outside the workshop. His large frame almost matched the door opening. He held his hand out, dangling a pickled wolf foot from a string. It was covered in ice crystals. “Oh, no problem. I can fix that for you.”

[how does pickling work? Taxidermied?]

Tormael dropped the foot as she reached out for it. “See you tomorrow.”

Ersatzica barely caught it. “Oh, I’ll have it fixed here in a few minutes.”

“Tomorrow. I go now.” He walked away.

Ersatzica put the foot on a shelf. Then she turned back to the boots. No use in fixing it soon if it won’t be needed until tomorrow.

The boots called to her. She embraced them in both her arms. The boots felt warm and welcoming, as if they were hugging her back. She had felt connections like this to other heirlooms, but none as strongly as this one.

She placed the boots on the ground, and scooted her stool to be right next to them. She tried to slip a wolf foot in, but it wouldn’t fit, even with the latches swung all the way open.

[mention Alpha before this]

“I promise Alpha, I wish I could try you on. To see what you are, to learn more about you.”

It was as if Alpha himself had granted her a wish, from a top his perch on the moon.

A feeling started in her toes. It was tingling, a slight numbness, like her fur was being pulled. Then the tips of her toes cracked and flipped upwards, disappearing into her foot. The white fur of her wolf socks ceded way to an orange, stripy fur. But more importantly, they were now smaller.

Ersatzica clapped in excitement, giddy about a wish coming true. How did it happen, and why? That wasn’t important.

She dipped her toes into the boots, which hugged her feet, welcoming them inside. The orange fur crept up her foot, her ankle, and her calves, letting her fit snugly into the boots.

Without clasping the boots, she lifted them up, one by one, to see how heavy they were. Despite being made of metal, they felt light enough to move about easily. She walked around her workshop a little, stomping about, clanging the metal boots on the stone floor. Then she returned to her stool.

Reaching down, she clasped the boots shut. The world around her demanded her attention. The door, it creaked? Even when shut and stationary? The wind blew through its cracks, around the workshop, and out the window, pushing the pane ever so slightly to make occasional scraping noises, and jittering the jars ever so slightly. The whipper-whirls outside were singing their nightly songs from their nests all the way down by the river. And the townsfolk! The walls usually muffled their voices into unintelligible murmurs, but now they were unmistakable whispers.

[react to body changes more?]

“Is this what it’s like to be Wryonin, all the time?” She wondered. She said it out loud, but this time, she didn’t hear her own voice. She got up and stomped around the workshop. No noise. She took her screwdriver and tapped it on the counter. No noise. She picked up the frozen wolf foot, and smashed it with a hammer. No noise. She picked up an ice shard and threw it at the door. It made a small *PIP* when it hit, and a small *PAT* when it fell to the floor.

She sat down and unlatched the boots. Immediately the world fell silent, and her breathing spoke up again.

“You give super hearing and silent stepping! That’s wonderful!” Ersatzica slipped the boots off. “You have such an amazing effect. Whoever gets you is going to really enjoy…”

The orange fur crept up her thighs. It was almost to her waist.

“Oh, and you also turn wolves into cats?” She brushed the transition line with her paw, as if she was pulling a skirt down. “You have more effects than most. You really are quite special.” She whimpered. The orange fur didn’t stop advancing. “But you can stop now. I took you off, that means you have to stop effecting me.”

Ersatzica jumped off her stool and walked away from the boots. The orange fur kept advancing. “This isn’t right.” She demanded.

The boots gave off warm, positive vibes. They offered her a consoling, welcoming hug.

“No, no, no.” Ersatzica frantically threw open her cupboards. “This can’t be happening.” She pulled out a lock that was rusted shut and quickly strapped it to her waist. “This ends now.”

A blue shimmer crossed the lock. It seemed to bolt shut tighter than it already was. The strap around Ersatzica’s waist tightened like thorny vines.

Still, the orange fur advanced from her legs to her waist, crossing the strap into her belly. In fact, it sped up, reaching her tail and quickly turning it from black to orange, and topping it off with a red tuft.

She grabbed her tail in shock. It was a cat’s tail. “I didn’t need *this*! I just wanted to fit into the boots!”

Her eyes widened. Of course! You don’t put Ordaent’s Lock on the victim of the heirloom, you put it on the heirloom itself! That’ll stop its effects!

She unstrapped herself and strapped the boots together. The boots protested as she strapped them to the lock, and it broke her heart to do so, but she couldn’t live as a cat. Usually transformation heirlooms reversed their transformation when taken off or removed, but if this one wasn’t going to, she had to take every measure she could to protect herself. Even if that meant making an heirloom unhappy.

Remorsefully, the boots accepted the lock’s effects. The blue shimmer on the boots dimmed.

But the transformation didn’t slow. In fact, it got more painful. The skin near the base of her tail peeled off, dangling on her back as the transformation continued.

“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Ersatzica cried. She unstrapped the lock from the boots, letting the lock slip off her desk and clang onto the floor. The blue shimmer returned to the boots. “Please stop! Please just stop!”

*AWOOO—* She turned her muzzle up to cry for help, but stopped herself. What if she was a cat when help came? How would the others respond? There’s no way to know. Best to wait it out, and figure it out from there.

She put the boots on, and latched them up. Now she could let out all the howls of pain she wanted without attracting unwanted attention.

[describe the transformation going across her belly scar]

But it was *painful*. The skin peeling moved up her back, tormenting her sensitive nerves, and pulling at her new orange fur. It wasn’t even in a place she could lick easily. She howled silently.

The orange fur advanced down her arms, slightly changing their proportions, and flinging her finger tips back into her fluffy hand paws. She drove her fists into her legs to try and quell the pain in her neck, but instead found a new pain: several sharp knives stabbing her thighs. She pulled her hands back, whimpering.

Her old wolf skin hung from the back of her head, as the hairs were pulled out one by one as it peeled itself off her scalp. Then, as if taking off a mask, her face peeled off, starting at her forward, reaching down around her eye sockets, and down her nose. Her muzzle snapped back into her face, leaving her old skin feeling like a wet rag on her nose. Her new jaw was full of teeth even sharper than before. Finally, with her cheeks peeling off in one last painful burst, she was free of her old wolf skin.

The old wolf skin hung limply on top of her head. She shrieked in disgust as she shook violently to get it off. But it was as if her muscles didn’t know how. She just awkwardly shook her head back and forth instead. Finally, she gingerly picked up the skin by the nose and flipped it over her head, jumping to the other side of the room as it landed.

Her heart beat rapidly as she assessed her new condition. Using a mirror, she found that her face was much smaller, and oranger, with a white muzzle. Her green eyes glowed even in the night’s darkness. Red hair flowed from her head to her shoulders, where her orange-striped arms attached. She had white furry gloves, and a strange arrangement of knuckles, with no claws? Ah, there were claws, just hidden.

The rest of her body was all orange. Surely, there’s such a thing as an orange wolf, right? Just because she’s smaller than before, orange, and have feet that can fit into a cat’s boots, doesn't mean she’s a cat, right?

The cat boots around her feet hugged her, comforted her, welcomed her to cathood.

Ersatzica shook her head. This can’t be happening. It didn’t work! The treacherous lock didn’t work! It was supposed to stop the heirloom from working, but it didn’t! And these boots! How did they have so many effects?? That’s not how heirlooms are supposed to work!

Ersatzica slumped onto her stool, buried her face in her hands, and cried.

“Ersatzica!” Mudrich yelled from across the town.

Ersatzica looked out the window. It was dark, and that meant curfew, and bedtime. Her eyes widened, and her ears flipped back. She paced around her workshop.

How is she going to go to the barracks like this? As a cat? But how can she not go? If she stays, the first place they’ll look for her is her workshop. And when they find her and they see that she’s a cat, they’ll… they’ll…

Well, they won’t find her. She’ll leave. But how? Her workshop is in the middle of town. How could she possibly get out without anyone…

“Ersatzica!” Mudrich opened the workshop door.

# Chapter 4 – Nosalen’s Foot

Ersatzica quickly hid in a corner and unlatched the boots. “Oh, hi Mudrich!”

“Ersie, is that you?” She sniffed around.

“Yes, of course it is. Why wouldn’t—”

“Do you smell a cat?”

“Mudrich, I’ve been doing nothing all day but working on an heirloom that an old cat *died*.”

“Oh… right.” Mudrich tapped on the door. “Well, anyway, did you get the boots fixed?”

“In a way…” Ersatzica stared out the window. The guards were posted in their usual positions.

“So?”

“Uh… no, you can’t try them out. They’re not fixed so that you can use them.”

“Mud luck!” Mudrich spat. “Well, anyway, Wryonin says it’s time for bed.”

“Sure, just let me finish up here.”

“Want some help? I can light your lantern for you.”

“No!” Ersie threw her screwdriver at Muddy. “I mean, the new heirloom is a bit light sensitive.”

“Your voice sounds different.”

“It’s because of the boots.”

“The boots just change your voice?”

“That… and other things.”

“Huh, well that’s disappointing.”

“Yeah, heh, voice changing boots.”

“I was hoping for super speed. You know, to go with these super strength cuffs!”

“Yeah, hey Muddy, can you give me some time? I’ll be right over as soon as I’m done with this.”

“Ok, but don’t take too long. Wryonin says he wants to have a word with us about the whole secret room thing.”

“Sure thing. Ok bye.”

“Bye.” Mudrich left.

The hair on the back of Ersatzica’s neck stood on end. She only bought herself a little time. It was only a matter of time before another wolf smelt the cat and came to inspect.

Latching the boots, she rounded up some useful tools into a sack, including her trusty screwdriver, some maintenance supplies, straps, Ordaent’s Lock, and of course, Nosalen’s Foot.

If she couldn’t turn back into a wolf, she would have to go to the cat outpost, and hope for the best. Maybe they would have some idea about how these boots work and how to undo their effects. And to get to the cats, she would have to cross the river. And she’d rather not have to rely on the kindness of a ghost again. Nosalen’s Foot can freeze water, hopefully it’ll be enough to cross a river.

She peeked out her workshop door. There were no guards immediately in her vicinity. She opened the doors and sprinted to the nearest shadow. There were plenty of lanterns throughout the village, but there weren’t enough to cover it all. The way directly to the staircase down to the forest was very well lit, and the staircase was also very well lit. There was no way to get down there without being seen. But without being heard? That was easy, thanks to the boots.

Ersatzica darted around the village, jumping from shadow to shadow, finding opportunities when no one was looking. The silent footsteps meant it remarkably easy to stay hidden. And the enhanced hearing made it easier to tell where everyone was.

Soon the staircase was in sight. Imraen, the guard, stood by it, watching out for anyone coming up. He always very sharp.

Passing hoof steps caught the attention of her ear. It was Nephalie. Deer magic has been known to transform people as well as walls. Maybe she could help her out of this mess.

Ersatzica called out to her, but the boots silenced her. Ersatzica unlatched the boots, and called out, “Nephalie!”

Nephalie’s ears turned before her head did. “Ers… atz… ica?”

“Here…” Ersatzica whispered as she hid behind a barrel.

Nephalie sighed. “Did you break another wall?”

“Not this time.”

“Good. Good night.” Nephalie got up.

Ersatzica pulled her down with her sharp claws.

“Ow.”

“Sorry.” Ersatzica rubbed the claw marks with her paw pads. “I need your help.”

“Can it wait until morning?” Nephalie yawned. “I’m exhausted.”

“Not really—”

“Also what did you do to me? I didn’t know wolf claws were so sharp. What did you do to your claws?”

“That’s the thing. That’s it. I need you to turn my claws back into wolf claws.”

“What did you mess them up or something?”

“Well, I found a new heirloom, and now my claws are… cat claws.” Ersatzica whispered as quietly as she could.

“Uh huh.” Nephalie nodded. “Nope! You’d have to talk to my aunt for that, and she’s not been around for who knows how long.”

“Why can’t you do it?”

“You think I can do that? I only know how to transform bricks into bigger bricks.”

“But isn’t it the same—”

“No! Also why are you hiding behind those barrels?”

“Can’t you at least try?”

“No, I’m tired. What are you hiding?”

“Nephalie…”

“Nevermind, I don’t want to know.” She walked off.

“Nephalie!”

“See you tomorrow, Ersatzica. I hope you figure out your cat problem.”

Shoot. That was the best chance she had of a quick fix. Apparently even deer magic has its limits. She strapped the boots back up.

“Is something wrong, Nephalie?” Imraen asked.

“I’m off work hours and Ersatzica is requesting immediate service. For something I don’t even do.”

“Well, she is daughter of the chief, so you have to obey her orders.”

“I’m tired, wolf. Can’t I just go to bed?”

Imraen left his post! Now was the perfect chance to run down the stairs.

“No, deer. You get over there and fulfill your orders.” Imraen grabbed Nephalie by the scruff of the neck.

Ersatzica dashed down the stairs, just out of view of the plateau.

“Let go of me!”

Ersatzica flinched. Nephalie didn’t deserve this. She unlatched the boots. “Hey! Imraen! Let Nephalie go!”

“Ersatzica?” Imraen turned around, but didn’t drop Nephalie. “But she disobeyed an order.”

“I dismissed her. Let her go!”

“But—”

“That’s an order!” Ersatzica stood straight up, and stared daggers into Imraen’s eyes.

“Ca—” Imraen stared back at Ersatzica, mouth agape. “Caaaat!” He dropped Nephalie. Drawing his sword and charged at Ersatzica. “Die!”

“No, it’s me! Stop!” Ersatzica quickly relatched the boots. She ran down the stairs as fast as she could, careful not to trip over any loose pebbles.

*AWOOOOOO!* “Enemy!”

*AWOOOOO! AWOOOOOO! AWOO! AWOOOOOO!* The whole town erupted into a howl.

“She’s still not back yet?” Wryonin grumbled.

“She said she’d just be a few minutes.” Mudrich played with her cuffs, swinging her legs off her bed.

Lemilay slipped into bed. “She’s probably roped into one of her projects again. Just let her sleep in her workshop. Let’s get to bed.”

*AWOOOOOO!* “Enemy!”

*AWOOOO!* Wryonin replied. “Let’s go, girls.”

Mudrich jumped out of bed and grabbed her hammer in one smooth motion, beating Wryonin out the door.

Wryonin calmly took his utility belt off the wall and strapped it on himself. He took out his slingshot and send a pebble bouncing off the bedframe right next to Lemilay’s head. “Come on.”

Lemilay growled, but got up anyway. She stood behind Wryonin, grabbing him by the arm.

“What are you doing?”

“I’m going to need a guide. Be my eyes.”

Wryonin rolled his. “Don’t slow me down. First we go find Ersie.”

They went straight to Ersie’s workshop, where they found a dark scene. The door had been left wide open. Several tools and supplies were scattered everywhere, even more than was normal. And worst of all, there was a wolf skin lying on the ground, with the exact fur pattern of their sister.

Lemilay, eyes normal gasped in shock, and immediately left the scene.

Wryonin knelt down and picked it up, sniffing it with his scarred nose. It smelled vaguely of cat. It was very soft in his hands, something he had never realized about Ersatzica’s fur before. Strangely, there was no blood.

“Wryonin? Where’s Ersie?” Mudrich entered.

“Mudrich, you didn’t fix the wall, did you?”

“Well…”

“Lemilay saw it. What did you find?” Wryonin growled, baring his teeth.

“Ok, ok!” Mudrich dropped her hammer. “We found this old pair of boots. Ersie was working on them today and—”

“Ok. And where are the boots now?”

“I don’t know, Ersie must have—”

“Ok. Where is she?”

“I don’t—”

“Can you smell her?”

“All I smell is a cat.”

“Good enough. Let’s go. Lemilay!”

“I’m not! I’m not doing it!” Lemilay cried.

“I’m not asking you to. Can you track a cat?”

Lemilay’s eyes rolled into her head and her bald spot glowed. “It went this way.”

Ersatzica ran down the stone stairs. Imraen, the wolf guard, chased close behind. Ersatzica was never the fastest wolf, and thus as a cat, she was also slow. But she had a head start.

Another wolf, Byporf, was running up, sword drawn. There was nowhere for Ersatzica to run now, except down. She got to the edge of the staircase where it made a 180 degree zigzag turn and jumped down the side. She intended to grab the cliff face on the opposite side, but it was too slippery. She fell off the wall. She landed on her feet, the boots sliding forward, pushing her onto all fours. Breathing heavily, she assessed her situation. Nothing broken, not even a bruise. All her things were intact, too.

Above, both Imraen and Byporf were looking down on her. Her pleading eyes were met with hateful looks. Imraen spat on her.

Ersatzica ran through the forest. The wolf guards would have to take the long, zigzag way down the stone railingless stairs. They could sniff her, but she’d have enough time to run away before they caught up. As long the night guards weren’t stationed at the river. They could surround her and take her out. So far, all the howling was behind her. It was getting closer and closer, but the river was just within reach.

First one drop, then another. Then a whole downpour. The sky aided in her escape. The rain soaked her fur and cooled her cat skin. As she shivered in the pouring rain, she smiled, thanking Alpha for his help. Now the wolves wouldn’t be able to track her scent.

Ersatzica got to the river. The moon illuminated it through the storm clouds. The river roared, as if daring Ersatzica to cross it. Last time she swam through it, it was calmer and she was upstream, and it still almost carried her over the waterfall. Crossing would be no easy task.

But this time, she was prepared. She reached into her sack and pulled out Nosalen’s Foot. It was cold to the touch, and covered in ice. Rain had gotten in and covered it. Ersatzica held it up to the moonlight. Rain drops bounced off it and trickled down her arms. It wasn’t freezing all the rain.

“It break.” Ersatzica could hear the chef’s voice in her head as she searched through her bag.

Everything was wet and soaked, and she couldn’t find any shelter to help her stay dry. She pulled out her trusty hammer, and pounded the foot until the broke off. But every time she broke off some ice, rain pelted the foot and froze back onto it. She couldn’t keep the foot thawed in the heavy rain. And without the foot to freeze the river, she didn’t dare try crossing the river.

She could search for a better place to cross, but she knew the river was wide all along the bank. And the wolves were deep in the woods looking for her. She would risk them finding her.

She tried to make a make-umbrella for the foot out of straps and fabric, but it soaked up the rain and dripped onto the foot. She also wasn’t able to hold the tarp with one hand, which made holding the tarp and breaking the ice impossible.

Out in the woods, several torch lights shown through the branches. She would be having company soon if she wasn’t careful. They were like tiny menacing eyes of a creature eager to kill her for killing’s sake, just meandering out in the forest as if blind.

But among them, one focused, seeking light shown. It was white and circular, and it didn’t bother searching every nook and cranny on the way. It knew exactly where she was, and it was coming for her. Lemilay!

Ersatzica scrapped the tarp idea and shoved her supplies back into her sack, accidentally wrapping the hammer up in the tarp. She pulled out Ordaent’s Lock, and applied it to the foot.

The white light got closer. Ersatzica moved out of the moonlight to work in the shade of a tree.

Without her hammer, resorted to pounding the foot against a tree. It made no sound as it hit, although ice still shattered off it. With the lock right up against it, the foot didn’t freeze the ice. Instead, it soaked it in.

The light was close enough now that Ersatzica could make out her sister’s beady little eyes rolled back into her head, and could hear her pants and footsteps as she ran. She wasn’t alone, either.

She hit the lock and foot against a tree one last time before holding out the pair to the river. She let the lock up, and the foot froze the river beneath it.

The water froze instantly, despite being several feet away from the foot. However, the ice still flowed downstream. Walking across wasn’t going to be easy with such a turbulent river.

“Hold it right there!” Wryonin yelled. “Don’t go anywhere!”

A rock flew by Ersatzica, grazing her stomache fur.

Lemilay was closing in, her bald spot almost blinding Ersatzica in the cold, wet darkness.

Ersatzica didn’t take any chances. She struck the foot with the lock, then palmed the foot to the river. And she jumped.

She landed on a solid sheet of ice. The ice swayed as she landed, knocking her off balance. She grabbed the edge of the ice with one hand, and with the other, she swung the foot around, increasing the amount of surface area of ice she had to work with. Eventually the ice expanded enough to give her a stable boat of ice.

Back on the shore, Lemilay’s light glared at her, accompanied by a shadow with a slingshot.

*PING!*

A rock hit her ice raft, cracking it.

*PING!*

Another rock.

*PING! PING! PING!*

The raft cracked under the attacks. It would’ve made such an interesting noise if it wasn’t forced to be silent.

The heavy rain pelted the raft. Ever the resourceful one, Ersatzica wiped water over the cracks and exposed it to the foot, healing the cracks. Her raft was intact.

The river roared, but the waterfall roared louder. The river was illuminated by the moon, but then it just ended, engulfed by a black void.

Ersatzica got up to run across the river, but found that her left boot was stuck in the ice, frozen solid. She was part of the raft.

*PING!*

Ersatzica got an idea. She’s never known Wryonin to miss a shot, especially when it counts. And she’s never known him to show mercy to a cat. That means he’s been missing his shots. He also has really good hearing.

Ersatzica unlatched the boots. The roaring river roared slightly less loudly, and her breathing was rapid, and faster than her audible heart beat. She banged the lock against the ice. The ice cracked a little, but it was thicker than the ice that collected on the foot. That, and the awkward angle made it hard to hit with enough force to break the ice.

*PING!*

The rock landed exactly where Ersatzica had been tapping.

*PING!*

With that last hit, the ice broke and Ersatzica was free.

*PING!*

This time, the rock hit the boots, denting one of the latches.

Ersatzica quickly snapped the latches shut. The last latch wouldn’t shut properly. But still, she was quiet and the world was loud.

*PING!*

The next rock whizzed by her face.

Foot in hand, she ran to the edge of the raft, running away from the waterfall. But she was closing in on it faster than she could run away from it. So she ran to the other side of the river, allowing herself to get dragged ever closer to the waterfall.

*PING!*

The raft was almost as wide as the river now. She was close to the other side. The river froze into sheets of ice as she ran.

*PING!*

Now she was just a few steps away from the other side. She took another step, but the ice cracked and flipped, and her feet slipped out from under her.

The head of the raft toppled over the waterfall, cracking and crumbling as the support underneath it vanished. Her piece of it, still connected, swayed and threw her off balance.

She grabbed on to the edge, but it was no use. She was going over the waterfall.

The moment it happened, it was like she was suspended in midair. Then the wind rushed up at her face as she accelerated downward, the hairs on the back of her neck pricking, all her fur standing on end. She stood like a bullet, diving feet first into the river below. The ice sheets all toppled down below her. She held out the foot to her feet, screaming at the top of her lungs, but silently.

Ice fragments flew everywhere, mixed with the fog from the rain and flowing water.

The ice beneath froze solid, and she landed feet first onto it. The boots slid forward on their plates, forcing her to her knees. She landed on a newly created piece of ice, from a deadly drop, and didn’t even have a scratch.

The moon was bright, still shining down on the river through the storm clouds. Ersatzica was trapped in a narrow corridor with steep rock walls on both sides. It was going to be hard to get out of this one, and she didn’t want to go all the way down the river. She had no idea where it led. She was trapped.

Just around the bend, the moon revealed a log trapped in the river too. It was stationary, somehow lodged in place. She crawled over to it, expanding her new ice raft as she did. The ice formed around the log, staying in place. She expanded the raft a little more, widening it to the whole width of the river, which was only about twice her height.

She held onto the log for dear life, waiting out the storm.

The sounds of the wolves were drowned out by the rain, and she felt safe from the immediate threat that they posed. Not even Lemilay was likely to find her here. No one was.

She unlatched the boots.

“I’m… I’m alive!” She yelled. “I’m here! I’m here!” She raised her chin to the moon. “AWOOO!” She gagged. Her throat did not want to cooperate. She was drenched and tired, and alone.

The moon shone warmly through the rain clouds, illuminating down on Ersatzica.

She looked up to it. “Alpha, Wolf God of the Loyal Moon, please help me.”

# Chapter 5 – Yotleph’s Skull

Ersatzica slept under the stars that night in the river.

In the morning, when she woke up, she was shivering and sneezing. Her nose was dripping and she was miserable.

She patted herself down. Her fur was intact, her belly scar was still there, her tail was complete with the red tuft, and all four limbs and both ears were present. Peeking into her sack, she confirmed all her belongings were still there.

Nosalen’s foot was covered in ice, several layers below the surface of the ice raft. The lock was also frozen into the raft. She must’ve dropped them while she was asleep.

The boots were again stuck into the ice, but this time it wasn’t so bad. She wiggled them around a little and they popped right out.

The sun was shining, beaming directly into the river canyon she found herself in, but the ice raft showed no signs of melting.

“How am I going to get out of this one?”

The sides of the canyon were too steep and smooth to climb. The river flowed through the mountains, twisting and winding, taking a path that was totally unknown to her. The heirloom she relied on was stuck in the ice.

She didn’t really have any good options.

She took her trusty screwdriver out and scraped at the ice, trying to get the foot out. Pounding the ice to crack it risks breaking the whole raft, and trying to melt the ice away would prove fruitless against the foot’s power.

After about an hour of scraping and blowing the ice scrapes, she realized she hadn’t packed any food. Her stomache grumbled as she picked away at the ice.

Finally she was able to scrape the foot out of the ice. She held it above the river and it worked like normal, freezing the water under it instantly.

She stood up, stabilizing herself with the tree. Then with all her belongings, she held the foot out in front of her and walked upstream to the waterfall.

As she approached, the mist kicked up from the waterfall crystalized in the air, falling like snow onto the ice road she made. She held the foot out to the falls itself, and it instantly froze around the foot.

However, it didn’t do quite as she imagined. The frozen water fell from the air as a solid sheet, splashing into the river below her feet. The water flowing from above was still liquid, and it created a steady flow of small ice sheets.

Ersatzica’s eyes lit up. She kept the foot there, in a place where it couldn’t easily be drenched by the falls, and waited for the sheets to come. Upon touching the water, the sheets didn’t instantly break or melt, so they just kept piling up.

But to her dismay, she realized that they were being washed away under her ice road.

So she froze the area under the falls to make a floor for the ice sheets. This resulted in the water flowing over her road, freezing her boots to it.

“Well, at least I’m not slipping away.”

Now that she had a base for the new water to freeze to, she could start working on a structure to get back up. She figured out that freezing to the canyon wall made it sturdier, so she froze it up against the cat side of the river. She climbed up the handlebars of ice all the way to the top.

The foot was getting very warm by the time she got there.

But at the top, she found that the bank was a bit taller than the current river level, and that trying to freeze the river water in this position didn’t help much. She was stuck.

“Take my hand, Your Majesty.” A clawed paw hand invited her to the cat side of the river.

She took it, and it pulled her up. She clambered up onto the bank on all fours, trying to shake the water off. But her usual post-bathtime instinct didn’t kick in. Instead, she just had to soak it in.

She looked up at her saviour. He was a black and white cat in a red-feathered green hat.

“You’re the ghost!” Ersatzica screamed.

“Hey calm down,” the cat said, raising an arm over his face. “I didn’t ghost you, Your Majesty. I was just getting in out of the rain. Your Majesty.”

“Huh?”

“I just left to get an umbrella, Your Majesty. I’m so so sorry you ended up down there, Your Majesty.”

Ersatzica stared at him. She poked him. He was real.

“But hey, it looks like you got a lot of good loot, Your Majesty?” The cat knelt down to look at the boots. “Some shiny boots, a creepy cooked foot, and a sack of goodies.”

“It’s all I could take with me.”

“Well, you did a fine job.” He grimaced. “Please don’t hurt me, Your Majesty.”

Ersatzica stared at him. She didn’t know what to expect meeting a cat for the first time, but it wasn’t this. He wasn’t at all scary or menacing like she thought he would be.

Her stomach growled.

“Oh! You must be hungry! Come! I’ve caught some fish! …Your Majesty.” He walked off along the bank and then suddenly disappeared.

Ersatzica knelt there, bewildered.

He reappeared again. “Aren’t you coming?”

Ersatzica nodded, got up, and walked over to him.

He disappeared again. Just walked away, and gone. She followed after him, and found that he magically reappeared, sitting on a blanket with a basket full of fish. Next to him was a wolf jaw bone with most of its teeth missing. A blue streak shined across it.

Ersatzica took a step back. All of it disappeared. In its place was a patch of dirt and some grass. She stepped forward again. It all came back. She took out her screwdriver, and poked everything. It was all real. She stepped in and out a few more times.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” the cat said. “I know this isn’t your favorite fish, Your Majesty, and you prefer them cooked, but this was all I caught today so far.” He held out a fish, letting it hang limply from his hand. “Your Majesty.”

Ersatzica looked at it for a second. Its bulbous eyes protruded from its oily scales and its wide-open mouth pleaded for it to be over. She snatched it from his hand and took a big, deep bite into its side.

The cat flinched away. “I’m glad you like it.”

Eratzica gobbled it all up, and licked the bits off the bones.

“Still hungry?” He gave her another one.

She gobbled that one up, too.

After she ate that one, she licked her lips, and let a hearty burp escape. Then she hugged him. “Oh, thank you so much!”

The cat winced at first, but then patted her on the back. “Heh, heh. I’m glad you liked it. Your Majesty.”

Ersatzica sat back down on the blanket. She stared at him, taking in all of his cat features. Is this more or less what she looks like now too?

“Wow, I can’t believe you actually hugged me. I didn’t think you would ever—” He put his arms up over his head, as if to guard against something.

Ersatzica sat and watched.

He peeked his eyes open, and upon seeing her calm expression, he relaxed his guard. “You’re not going to…?”

“Going to what?”

He tilted his head. “Did you, hit your head or something?”

Erssatzica held her head. “No, I don’t think so.” She sneezed.

“Oh, you might have a cold. Here, get up.” He moved the jaw bone off the blanket. He picked up the basket by the handle, but it was broken and he immediately remembered to pick it up with both hands from the bottom. He moved it next to the jawbone in the grass. Now with the blanket vacant, he wrapped her in the blanket. “Feeling better?”

“A little bit.”

“So, how did you do it?”

“Do what?”

“Get away with all this stuff?”

“Well, I just packed my sack here and grabbed what I could. I didn’t have much time or I would’ve taken more with me.”

“Did you snag anything for me?” He raised his arm to guard again. And again, when she didn’t react, he relaxed.

“Hmm…” she rummaged through her sack. “How would you like a strap?”

“A strap, Your Majesty?”

Ersatzica crawled out of the blanket and pulled out a strip of leather, two nails, and her faithful hammer. She wrapped the leather around the break in the basket handle and tapped the nails into the handle with the hammer. Then she filed down the points of the nails sticking through with the file part of her screwdriver, to keep it from pricking those who pick it up.

Then she lifted the basket up by the handle to demonstrate. Despite the weight in the basket, the handle didn’t break.

“You fixed it!” The cat proclaimed. He grabbed the handle and lifted it up and down several times. “Thank you so much!” He hugged her, but then immediately disengaged and flinched again.

Ersatzica held out her arms. He embraced her once again.

“So, you like hugs now, Your Majesty?”

“I guess… I do now, yeah.” Ersatzica couldn’t remember the last time she had hugged anyone. Then again, she couldn’t remember the last time anyone had saved her life twice in the same week before, either.

“Your majesty?”

“Yes?”

“Is it ok if I just call you Majestra?”

Ersatzica shrugged. “Sure, why not?”

The cat breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank you, Your Majest—uh, Majestra. I shall call you Majestra now.”

“And I shall call you… Fisher.”

“Fisher?” He smiled. “I like it. But…”

“So, Fisher, what are you doing on the river?”

“Waiting for you, of course.”

“Really?”

“Yes—are you sure you didn’t hit your head?”

“It’s been a long night in that cold river. Maybe I am a little ill.”

“Well let’s get you back to the outpost.” Fisher helped “Majestra” to her feet.

Still wrapped in the blanket, she got up and walked with him. Fisher offered to carry her sack of supplies, which she accepted.

When they entered the outpost, Fisher yelled out, “Hey! Your Majesty, Majestra is back!”

The outpost was a temporary settlement made of canvas tents, with a few permanent stone structures. The stone had the classic sign of deer magic, tear marks that streaked upwards, as if it was made of hardened taffy.

When Fisher got the attention of the outpost, the cats mulling about all stood and begrudgingly clapped, staring straight at Majestra. It was very awkward and forced.

An older cat emerged from a canvas tent. She wore various pieces of armor. “Majestra! My dear! Where is your armor?”

“She spent the night in the river, General Seamtrust.” Fisher explained.

“Well why did it take you so long to get out? You’re all wet.” She put a hand on her shoulder and led her into the canvas tent.

“General Seamtrust?” Ersatzica looked up at her.

“Majestra, dear,” General Seamtrust cooed once inside. “Why so formal with your auntie? What happened? Was that cat bothering you again? Does he need more punishment?”

Ersatzica’s eyes widened, then she nodded slowly, while staring into the space behind General Seamtrust. “No, …auntie.”

“Well what then? Speak, child.”

“Like he said, I spent the night in the river. I barely escaped the wolves.”

“Well, it’s good to see you survived. Now tell me the mission report.”

“Mission report?”

“Yes, are you daft? Tell me what happened on the mission.”

“Well, I lost all my things, but I managed to snag these items.” Ersatzica pointed out the items: the boots, the paw, and the contents of the sack.

“What about the tooth I lent you?”

Ersatzica shook her head.

“And the…”

“Nope.”

“Well!” She put her hands on her hips. “This just won’t do! You must step up your game, your little majesty, if you want to take command of the town. This is really unbecoming of a lead—”

“I’ll make it up to you.”

“You better! Are you still able to stick to the schedule?”

“Yes.”

“So you’ll be ready for the mission in 2 days?”

“Yes.”

“Come here.” She grabbed Ersatzica’s face in her palms and directed her to look up at her, then brought her in close for a hug. “Make me and your mama proud, little majesty.”

“Yes, auntie.”

Ersatzica stepped out of the canvas tent with her stuff. She looked bewildered out at the outpost, not sure where to go.

“Majestra! Are you ok?” Fisher was waiting outside.

“Yes, yes, I’m quite fine.” Ersatzica raised her head high, mimicking Auntie Seamtrust. She eyed Fisher out of the corner of her eye; he was flinching. She dropped the act. “I’m… not feeling well. Can you take me to the medic bear?”

Fisher relaxed. “Medic bear? I don’t know what that is, but I can take you to the doctor.”

Fisher took Ersatzica to the medic tent. The medic cat checked her out and said she was fine. They gave her some headache medicine that she hesitantly accepted.

As the day wore on, it was time to go to bed. Ersatzica asked Fisher to escort her to her barracks, and he escorted her to her sleeping room: one of the few stone structures in the outpost. Two guards were stationed just outside. Ersatzica said good night to Fisher.

[TODO: Fill in this in more detail]

Then the next morning, Ersatzica followed Fisher to the beach.

“Your next mission isn’t until tomorrow. Are you sure?”

“I want to… observe the wolf side from this side.”

“Ok.”

They sat down on the blanket. Fisher set the skull, basket, and fishing equipment on it.

“So, Fisher,” Ersatzica said.

“Yes, Majestra?”

“Have you tried howling? When you make announcements? I see your people yelling a lot to get attention.”

“Howling? You mean like wolves?”

“Oh, right.” Ersatzica looked down. “Well then how do you pray to Alpha?”

“Alpha… the wolf god?”

“Yeah.”

“We… don’t. *You* don’t, do you?”

Ersatzica looked away. “Uh, no, of course not.” She played with her claws, flipping them in and out. “I mean, I have to study the wolves for my mission.”

“Right.”

After a while of talking on the beach, a familiar face appeared. A white wolf came up and sat on a boulder on the other side of the river. She looked down into the water.

Ersatzica jumped up, waving her arms.

“You know she can’t see you, right?” Fisher whispered.

“Oh, right.” Ersatzica took a deep breath in, then yelled, “Mudrich!”

Fisher jumped up and put a hand over her mouth. “Shh!”

Mudrich looked around. She stood up, turning around, trying to find the source of the noise.

“Don’t give away our position! It’ll compromise our mission.”

“Oh, right.”

*AWOOOOO!* Mudrich let out a baleful cry. It was the special howl they use when they try to find each other.

Ersatzica wanted so desperately to respond, but not only could she physically not, she also couldn’t risk putting herself in danger. Her arms drifted down slowly and her excitement waned.

Fisher shushed her, covering her mouth with his hand.

Finally, after a few minutes, Mudrich left.

Fisher relaxed. “What was that about?”

“Uh, nothing.”

“How did you know that wolf’s name?”

“Like I said, I’ve been studying them.” Ersatzica searched for a new topic. “So for tomorrow’s mission. Are you coming with me?”

“Into the wolf village? No way.” Fisher sat down and cast a fishing line into the river. “That’s your job.”

“Then can I take this skull with me?”

“No. Don’t you have your necklace?”

“What neck… Oh, no, I lost it.”

“Ah, the storm, yes.” Fisher nodded. “That’s too bad.”

“What did my necklace do? I mean, which necklace are you talking about?”

“You had more than one? I only seem to remember you having the one, you know with the tooth from the skull attached to it.”

“The tooth was removed from the skull?” Ersatzica whispered to herself.

“Yes. Are you feeling ok, Majestra?”

“Uh, yes. Of course I am.”

“So are you feeling up to exploring the forest?”

“Sure!”

“Really? I thought you hated the forest.”

“…it’s not so bad, now that I’ve spent some time in it.”

“Sweet!”

“Wait, don’t you have to stand guard here?”

“Wow, you really don’t remember much, huh?” Fisher got up and held out a hand to Ersatzica. “My main job is to bring you back across the river after your mission. But since you’re here, I also have the day off!”

“Ok, where to first?”

“This way, Majestra.” Fisher took her by the hand and led her through the woods. They came to a hole in the side of a small hill.

“What’s this?”

“You wanted to know about the tooth necklace?” Fisher reached in and scooped up some dirt from inside the hole. “This is where it was found.”

*There once was an old and craggedy monster who blocked the cat’s advance into the valley for decades. It was a giant wolf, a terror to all cats. It had massive fangs and claws, and the more cats you threw at it, the easier time it had killing them all. Occasionally, it would disappear for days at a time, and the cats would advance into the valley. Those that did, never returned. When the wolf reappeared, it would be carrying a sack full of skulls, and leave it laying in the open for the cats to collect. It was known as the Phantom Guard, for the ghostly white fur pattern on its face, that looked like a skull, and the three stripes on its belly, that looked like a ribcage.*

“Yotleph!” Ersatzica interrupted.

“Yotleph?” Fisher quizzed.

“Yeah, that’s his name!”

“Ah, ok, Yotleph.”

*The Yotleph, as it was named, was a fierce wolf monster that terrorized the cats for years. Until one day, it vanished, like it had several times before. The cats waited a week, a month. No sign of the Phanto—The Yotleph. It was months before a single cat was brave enough to step foot into the valley.*

*When they finally did, they found the dead, headless bodies of their fallen cat comrades, littered around the forest. They tried to collect them all, but every single body was… trapped! I’m talking pit traps, hidden spikes, vine snares, all of it. A lot more cats were lost to the recovery project.*

“And then Yotleph comes out and kills them all!” Ersatzica said gleefully.

Fisher flinched.

“No, no, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.” Ersatzica rubbed Fisher’s shoulder. “Continue please.”

Fisher brought his arms back down.

*The Yotleph, in fact, did not jump out and kill them all, because it was also dead. No one knows how or when it died, but when its bones were discovered, the cats that found them simply vanished.*

Ersatzica gasped, covering her mouth.

*All that was found was its skull, eerily similar to the markings on its face. But some still say, that to this day, it haunts these very woods, waiting to behead the next cat that steps foot—*

“Yotleph is *dead*?”

“Well, so they *say*, but you never really know about ghosts…”

Ersatzica began to tear up.

“Ah, don’t cry. It’s ok. I’m sure these are just tales they tell to scare the recruits.” Fisher hugged Ersatzica.

“I’m… I’m not scared.” Ersatzica wiped a tear from her eye. “I’ve heard a different story about Yotleph.

*Yotleph was my uncle—I mean, he was an uncle. He had a family, a wolf pack, and he was an uncle to a litter of wolf cubs. He was big and strong, courageous, and loyal, like Alpha. He was the strongest and most experienced of his brothers, so he left the village to defend it the only way he knew how. He would be gone for weeks at a time, fighting off the bad cats. But he was also compassionate. Every month, he would return with shiny new gifts, heirlooms from the cats he had protected us—I mean the wolf village—from. My favorite was a screwdriver with multiple functions. It wasn’t an heirloom, per se, but it was my favorite tool—is my favorite tool.*

“*Your* favorite tool?”

“Yeah.” Ersatzica reached in and pulled out her screwdriver, handing it to Fisher to examine.

“That is a very nice tool. This is what you used to fix my basket?”

“Yes.”

Fisher thought for a moment. Then his eyes went wide. He looked Ersatzica up and down. “You’re… you’re not…” He gasped and backed away from her. “You’re not Majestra!”

Ersatzica dashed to him and covered his mouth. “Shhh!” She looked around to make sure no one else was listening. “Ok, I’m not Majestra. I’m a wolf in a cat’s body.”

Fisher tore her hand off his face and jumped to his feet. “What—what are you doing here?”

“Calm down, Fisher. I’m not here to hurt you.” She reached out to him, but he flinched, so she backed away.

“You’re not?”

“No! Look, have I been mean to you at all since I got here?”

Fisher lowered his arms. “Well, you didn’t scratch me, you didn’t punch me, and you didn’t kick me in the groin.”

“No, and I’m not going to.”

“So you’re not here to bury me like the Phantom Guard?”

“No. And actually, I need your help.”

“Ok, as long as you don’t promise to hurt me.”

“I promise.”

“Wait, I meant promise to not hurt me.”

Ersatzica clasped her hands around his and looked him in the eye. “I promise I won’t hurt you.”

Fisher breathed a sigh of relief. “So, what do you need?”

“I’m trapped in this cat body.”

“How?”

Ersatzica tapped the boots she was wearing.

“Ah.” He crouched down to examine them more closely. “They’re in pristine condition. The owner must have only recently passed.”

Ersatzica blushed. “Actually, I found them in an abandoned room on a poor old soul who had been forgotten for ages. I polished them up myself.”

“You did this? Wow!” Fisher looked at his reflection in the boots. “I don’t think I’ve heard of these boots before. What are they called?”

“The boots.”

“Yes, but *whose*?”

“I’m… not sure.”

“May I test them?” Fisher began to take them off her feet.

“No no!” Ersatzica brushed him off. “I’m not taking them off.”

“But if they turned you into a cat, then logically taking them off would turn you back into a wolf.”

“I tried that, it didn’t work.”

“Huh.” Fisher pondered. “Well there are other heirlooms that turn cats into wolves.” He pulled a book out of his basket. Its pages were filled with sketches of various items, their names, and what was known about them. Fisher flipped to a particular page. “The Wolf Skin of Monassus!” He proclaimed, presenting the book to Ersatzica. “This heirloom would turn you into a wolf. You’d have to wear it the whole time though. Sounds uncomfortable. Maybe even itchy.”

“Do you know where to find it?”

“It hasn’t been seen for over 15 years.” Fisher shook his head. “You’d have better luck asking the wolves.”

*AWOOOOOOO!* (“Here!”)

“Wolves!” Fisher jumped behind a bush.

Ersatzica calmed down Fisher, and together they followed the sound of the howl. Peeking through a bush on the river bank, they spotted three wolves on the other side of the river. “Shhhh.”

Ersatzica latched up both boots. The world came pouring into her ears. The wind whistled, the trees groaned, and the river roared. But just beyond, she could hear voices.

“Ersatzica! ErSAAAATZica!”

*AWOOOOOO!* (“Here!”)

It was her siblings!

Mudrich mournfully held up a wolf skin in the air as she howled as loud as her heart would allow.

“That looks like the Wolf Skin of Monassus.” Fisher said excitedly. “I guess you really would have better luck asking the wolves!”

“Those are my siblings!” Then she turned to Fisher and hugged him. “Thank you Fisher! I couldn’t have survived without you.”

“You’re welcome.”

She stood up, preparing to leave.

But he grabbed her hand.

“Don’t go.”

“What? Let go of me!”

“You’re the only one who’s ever been nice to me. If you become a wolf again, you’ll be my enemy. I don’t want to lose my only friend.”

“Don’t worry, Fisher. If we ever become enemies, remember, I made a promise. I won’t hurt you.”

“Yeah.” He hung his head. “Ok.” As he let go, he added, “Can I at least know your name?”

“Ersatzica.”

“It was nice knowing you, Ersatzica. We should spend time together again.”

Ersatzica smiled. “Sure.”

She waved down Wryonin, Mudrich, and Lemilay. Wryonin drew his slingshot, but Lemilay pushed it down. Mudrich cried howls of joy. Mudrich rowed a boat across to pick up Ersatzica, with Wryonin standing by, slingshot drawn.

When Mudrich rowed ashore, she stood and paused. “Ersatzica?”

“Oh, Muddy! It’s you!” She tried to hug her wolf sister, but Mudrich pushed her back.

“Hold on, hold on. I have to first ask you a few questions.”

“Huh?”

“Where did you find the boots?”

“In the wall behind our bedroom.”

“Who won the hole digging contest when we were kids?”

“You did, of course.”

“And how did you get your scar?”

“I was born with it.”

“Oh, Ersie! It *is* you!” Muddy hugged her back, but just for a moment. “Ah! Cat! Ew! Here, take this.”

Ersatzica held the wolf skin up to the sun. A blue shimmer streaked across it, welcoming her back. “The Wolf Skin of Monassus.” She put in on, snuggling her head into the “hood” first. It immediately took effect, changing her cat features into wolf from the head down. She slipped the boots off just in time before the changes got to her feet. She hugged herself. “Thank you, Monassus.”

Mudrich rowed her across the river. She was once again reunited with all of her siblings.

“Wryonin!” Ersatzica opened her arms wide.

“How could you do this?” Wryonin scowled.

“What?”

“Nevermind. Let’s get home before the cats spot us.” He walked into the woods, and they followed.

“I never thought I’d be so happy to see you, Lemilay.” Ersatzica went in to hug her sister.

Lemilay pushed her back. “Your little stunt cost me three weeks of extra work. I hope you’re happy.” She walked off.

Ersatzica hung her head.

She wasn’t able to contemplate long, as Mudrich lifted her up in a big squeeeeze hug. “I’m soooooo glad you’re back!”

She gasped. “Good… to be… back…”

As soon as Mudrich put her down, they both followed Wryonin and Lemilay.

“I was wondering where you were, why I smelled cat, and why would you just jump into the river. I’m so glad you decided not to defect to the cat kingdom!”

“Defect? What are you talking about?”

“Lemilay saw you turn into a cat and walk off with a bunch of heirlooms. Sounded like you were giving our stuff away to the enemy.”

“Oh, she saw that huh? I was hoping it was too dark.”

“So why did you run off?”

“I suddenly turned into a cat, and I didn’t know what to do.”

“Well you should’ve at least told me.”

“You’re right. I should’ve. I’ll do that next time.”

“Promise?”

“I promise.”

“Good. But hopefully there won’t be a next time.”

“I hope so too.” Ersatzica said, as she turned her head back to steal a quick glance. Fisher was waiting on the shore, waving goodbye. She smiled back, wagging her tail.
