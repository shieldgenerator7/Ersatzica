from PV22 Table Reads

on the nose, the characters say what they think all the time. find the emotional core of the story. bring it back to the core of the emtoinal core of the story

have more her reacting to the transformation instead of the details of the transformation


pull back slightly on detail, so reader can fill in details


need hints of character arc
the dialogue doesnt say anything about the character
sneak it into the dialogue

have the transformation be the result of an unfufilled desire of the main character
maybe desire to know her real parents? (thats weird)
being different?

write about what the character thinks about the object and less about the details of the object
details added need to serve the story your telling

dont be afraid to let the reader fill in hte gaps.
