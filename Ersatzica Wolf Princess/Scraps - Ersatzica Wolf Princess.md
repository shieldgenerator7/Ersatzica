# Ersatzica puts on boots near river for the first time

The dark grey granite rock was indeed rather flat for a boulder its size. It had plenty of space for about one or two of Ersie's projects. A very thin tree line separated it from the river bank, meaning Ersie had a great view of the river, and a little outcropping on the other side. Around the area were tons of trees with thick trunks that Mudrich liked to tie ropes to, for the purpose of raising a hammock. The trees also had a large canopy that provided cool shade to the work area.

"This is a nice spot, Ersie!" Mudrich placed a hand on the trees, shaking herself violently. "These trees don't move. That's good!"

"If I'm not allowed to work in my workshop for now, this isn't such a bad spot." Ersie took the boots out of the cart and set them on the slab. She looked out across the river at the outcropping. The outcropping where the fisher cat had been sitting the other day. Where is he now? Will Ersie ever see him again? What if Mudrich sees him? Will a whole river be enough to stop her from chasing him down?

"Ersie?" Mudrich looked out across the river. "What's over there? Do you see something?"

Ersie shook herself out of it. "No, I just like the view."

"It is a really nice location. How are you doing, by the way?"

Ersie gently rubbed her scar. "It's really sore. It feels like it could burst open any minute." Ersie took out some tools from the bag and laid them next to the boots.

"Oh Ersie you shouldn't be overexerting yourself. Here, let me set up your workbench for you." Mudrich unloaded the cart by dumping it wholesale onto the stone slab. Things went everywhere, including her tools, and the pile was topped by a fresh dusting of dirt, straight from the bottom of the cart.

Ersie sighed. "Thanks, Muddy."

"No problem!" Muddy set the cart down and began digging in the dirt. "I think I found something!" She dug with her wolf-clawed hands into the dirt, throwing the dirt between her legs directly onto Ersie's new workbench.

Ersie’s eyebrows lowered. "Mudrich, didn't you say you wanted to setup a hammock?" Ersie blew the dirt of the workbench.

"Oh yeah!" Mudrich got up, holding a dirty sharp metal object. "I found a… uh, cutting thing that you throw."

Ersie grabbed it and took a look. "I think it's a spearhead." She gave it back to Mudrich.

"Huh, isn't that a cat weapon? What's it doing here?"

"Well we are close to the border." Ersie gestured to the river. "And it is a throwing weapon."

"Right…" Mudrich nodded. She held the spearhead up to her face and gave it a big long lick.

"Muddy?!"

"There's a faint taste of blood." She smacked her lips. "I'd say it's probably wolf blood."

"Not surprising. Were you going to get the hammock? I might need to lay down soon."

"Oh right! Do you think we have time before the special workout session?"

"Yeah, if you hurry."

"Ok! Be right back!" Mudrich took off toward the town, leaving Ersatzica alone next to the cat border.

Ersie stopped dusting off the boots and her workspace to look at the outcropping across the river. Crossing the river is dangerous, especially for her. What would have happened to her if that fisher cat hadn't been there? There's a waterfall not too far from here. She would've gone over for sure. Not too many have went down it and survived.

Before she knew it, she was already out of the workspace area and next to the river, moments away from stepping in. What would it be like to be a cat? And not just for a few hours, but forever? And live among other cats? No, that's crazy. Cats are evil creatures, who will kill any wolf on sight. But no, that can't be true. Not *all* true. The fisher cat didn't kill her on sight, even though he could have.

A random howl rang out. The message was for her mother the chieftess. Nonetheless, it snapped Ersie out of her daze. She went back to the workbench and started working on the boots. It didn't take her long to get the dirt off them. She took them off the table and set them on the ground.

*Thud.*

She unlatched them. She stared at the open mouth of the boots, inviting her in. Mother told her not to wear them until she converted them to work with wolf feet. But she doesn’t have enough info. How do the mechanisms work? How are they supposed to fit to the form of the foot? More testing was necessary before the conversion began. And no one was around to see her…

Ersatzica slipped her wolf feet into the cat boots. "I wish I was a cat." With the magic words said, her transformation began again. It was just as weird as the first and second times, but this time she knew what to expect. This time, she gently folded her wolf skin and set it on the workbench. She latched the boots. Standing straight up, she held her scar for a moment and extended her arms into a t-pose. After a moment of wobbling, she steadied herself. She lifted one leg at a time. Still standing. She jumped into the air and landed feet-first. This time she didn't fall. She was getting the hang of these boots and her new cat form.

She walked around her workspace in the boots, taking notes as she went. There was a bottom plate in the interior of the boot that her pads comfortably rested on. Her heel had full support as well. The current adjustment of the top plates made the boots fit snugly around her feet so they didn’t jostle when she took steps. Interestingly enough, lifting her foot off the ground didn’t lift the boots from the top of the foot. Instead, the boot was lifted from the toe joint and ankle.

There were no holes for claws, but that didn’t bother her, as she had no claws protruding out. Her wolf feet, however, did. That’s going to be the hardest accommodation, most likely. Why don’t cats have claws? That’s weird.

Ersatzica returned to her workbench and donned her wolf skin. She placed the boots on her work table and got to work figuring out how to adjust the inner plates.

"Cat!" A wolf yelled from the woods. He howled into the air. Raising his axe, he charged at Ersatzica.

Ersatzica hissed. She put her head in the air to howl, but found she was unable to. Her eyes widened and her ears pinned back. She scrammed.

The forest was thick, but not thick enough to stop her from running. She only got a brief look at the wolf, but could tell it was one with battle scars and years of training. She felt her scar. It was already stretched thin from the workout, but now it was tearing. Her cat hand had drops of blood on it. She pushed through the pain, adrenaline rushing through her veins. She turned her ears behind her, and noted that the wolf was still on her tail, though he was not gaining any ground. The boots didn't make a sound, but they cushioned her every step, and pushed her off the ground in a springy motion. Were they making her run faster?

Ersatzica lengthend her stride, and her speed increased. The boots pushed her further faster through the woods. She was losing the wolf.

But soon she ran into the cliff face on the east side of the woods. Between the rushing river, the cliff, and the woods, she chose the woods. This way, she can get to the stairs that lead to the village. Mudrich will be there, and she can tell everyone that she's not a cat. She was half way there already, and she could see the top of the stairs through the tree tops.

Ersatzica's scar ripped open and a sharp pain erupted from the wound. She stumbled into a tree. Using it to brace herself, she covered her scar with her hand. She pressed on. It was just a little ways more to get to Mudrich.

"CAT! HERE!" A wolf howled out at the base of the stairs.

Several more wolves howled in response, "Coming!"

Ersatzica looked around. She was trapped. Mudrich was in the village. Her wolf skin she had left at her workbench. She couldn't go forward, and she couldn't go back.

But she could go up. As the wolves approached from all directions, she looked at the top of the cliff. She grasped onto a rocky ledge, but her cat fingers, with their two segments, weren't long enough to grip. She slid down the cliff face.

She really didn't want to die like this. How humiliating was it for a wolf to die disloyally as one of the enemy, killed by a member of their own tribe?

She held her scar, trying in vain to stop the bleeding. She approached the tree with her blood stains already on it and clambered up, one branch at a time. Hopefully, the wolves would not find her among the tree branches, or she could climb high enough to get on the top of the cliff. She got fairly high up into the tree.

As she clutched the branch above her, needles pierced her skin near her scar. She moved her hand away to look down at her belly, and the needles disappeared. What? She looked at her hand. Suddenly, they had three segments! And the third segment ended in incredibly sharp claws. She looked at her other hand. It also had the sharp claws. She stretched them, and found she could retract them into her hand.

"I smell…" The wolf who had found her stood at the bottom of the tree and took a deep breath through his nose. "…cat!" He howled maniacally, "Here!"

The other wolves arrived shortly thereafter.

"It's up there! Get it!"

Another, younger, wolf climbed up after Ersatzica. He held a dagger in his mouth. He growled at her when he reached her, wielding his knife.

Ersatzica looked at her hands, and the tiny knives at their ends. She reached down at swiped at the young wolf. She hit him right in the eye.

The young wolf recoiled in shock, losing his grip and tumbling down the tree onto the ground. CRUNCH. The young wolf howled in pain, holding his leg. It was bent backward, snapped in half at the shin.

"Tree!" Another wolf cried out, pulling the young wolf away. "The cat's in the tree!"

"Then we'll just have to…" The veteran wolf flung his axe around in an impressive display of mastery. "…cut it down!" He swung his axe and the whole tree shook.

How long will it take for him to cut it down? It doesn't matter. They'll wait it out until it happens. Ersatzica has to get out of the tree.

She looked around and found a tree branch from another tree close enough to transfer to from a branch of this tree. She climbed over to it, but before she could grab the other branch, the tree shook and she lost her grip. She fell straight to the ground, feet first. Bracing for impact, she expected the worst.

Once she hits the ground, and breaks her legs, it's all over. There's no way she can run away, fight them off, or persuade them otherwise. It's all hopeless now—

Ersatzica's feet made contact with the ground, and the boots absorbed all the impact. The springs compressed and the bottom plate slid forward, sending Ersatzica tumbling onto her hands. She was completely fine. She landed behind the wolves. So far not one of them seemed to have noticed that she escaped. The shaking tree was an eerily effective distraction. She ran off without a sound.
