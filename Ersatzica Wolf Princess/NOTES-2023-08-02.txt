end of chapter 8: have transformation be invopuntary, but have ersatzica recognize its happening

ersie seems so calm for randomly transofrming into a cat twice

muddy didnt notice cat ersie w/o boots?

ersie still in ddenial about being a cat, should be resisting the transdforms a little more

the trasnforms are a bit jarring for someone notin the know




ersie asks mudrich why shes being all quiet
mudrich should bring up destroying the boots in private maybe

"im going to be a cat permanently" needs to be more clearer conjecture, and not matter of fact

tail lengthening -> tail thinning

make it obv that the fire is right in front of the window

before muddy arrived, make it obvious muddy wasnt alreayd there

blood *dripped* out of lershas nose

dont have ersatzica pas out, make it obv she doesnt pass out

make muddy thank lersha

lersha comments about no swelling in the throat

maybe make it more obv that lersha sniffing comes from abilities and not from regular sniffing

make ersatzica defy mudrich's hepl with body lanugae instead of talking

why doesnt awoomoon say anything about this? even at night?



lemilay go behind ersies back to mother about boots, and then mother tells her to keep secret

lemilay gets mothers acceptance, and it helps her change

lemilay bes a bitch at some point to help ersie get out of tight situation


awwoomoon tells lemilay everything when she confronts her about boots problem
