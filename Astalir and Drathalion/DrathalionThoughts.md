Drathalion Thoughts

So Drathalion was born in a wolf tribe, and had three brothers who he got along great with. Then he went to the deer tribe because he was feeling weird about his body after puberty, and came back a she. She now wore a petrified deer hoof around her neck, which was the totem that held her new form together. She then lived happily among her family, especially after the adjustment period was over. But then she was unfaithful to her partner, and had sex with several single wolves. She was ostracized for this, and was exiled.

She traveled the lands, looking for a tribe that would take her in. She stayed with the aDirada deer tribe first, but left because she didn’t like deer dicks. She spent time in the Bear clan, where she trained as a healer and got the mark of Garoftle.

She asked queRenari-Ko if she would transform her into another species to make relocation easier. queRenari-Ko, seeing that Drathalion’s true form was a female wolf, denied the request.

Years later, she came back to the wolf village when she heard the news that her mom had passed. She showed up, but was overall not welcome and considered a traitor. Her mom, being her closest family member after the whole traitor incident, broke her heart when she died. Drathalion thought that her heirloom should belong to her, so she stole her mom’s wolfskin and fled.

She fled across the river and ended up in cat territory. She met a kind fisher cat who held a hat that could turn any species into a cat. So Drathalion donned the hat, and chose a cat name. She thought back to her time in the deer tribe, when her and her brothers would get bark turned into corn on the cob and eat it as a snack. So she called herself Tree’s Corn, and smushed it together as Treescorn. That became her new name.

As a cat, she was easily able to have multiple partners, even in the same night, and no one got mad at her for it. In fact, they loved her for it. Life was good. But life was empty. She yearned for someone, anyone, to stick around long enough for her to get to know them. One night stands weren’t doing it for her.

Wolves were hard to come by, but she found one in the cat empire. He turned out to be a monster who went crazy, killing cats. Worse yet, he had hindsight, so he could hunt down anyone he wanted. He targeted his exes first, and people who wronged him.

Or… maybe Treescorn met a cat who actually stayed with her, and this wolf killed him, so she started chasing him down.

Anyway, she met Astalir along the way, and they became close friends, despite his lack of people skills.

Ok im still iffy on the reasoning why she chooses to hunt the monsters with Astalir, but she does. They take down several monsters together, and slowly they become close friends.
