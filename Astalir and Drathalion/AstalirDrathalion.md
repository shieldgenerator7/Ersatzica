Astalir and Drathalion

It was a cool summer night, and the lanterns were doing the moon’s job. The tavern door swung open, letting yellow firelight pour into the dark.

An old drunk cat flew out and landed in the dirt. “Jut one mooore…” He clawed the doorframe to get up to his feet.

“No, Kettle Corn! You’ve had enough. I’m not serving you anymore until you’re sober!” A cat pushed him out into the night. “Go home!”

“But it’s sooo drak out here…”
