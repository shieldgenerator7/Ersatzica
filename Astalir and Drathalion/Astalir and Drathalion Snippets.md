# Astalir and Drathalion Snippets

Here are some snippets of a story I want to tell about Astalir and Drathalion, both characters originating from DnD campaigns I played in, but who am I porting over to Ersatzica’s world.

# Stick in the Mud

Treescorn tells a joke, and laughs.

Astalir continues on, face straight.

“Do you ever laugh?” Treescorn asks.

“No.”

“You’re a real stick-in-the-mud, aren’t you?”

“They’re called antlers, and I never sharpen them in mud.”

Treescorn stops walking. “Wow.”

# Treescorn’s Hoof Necklace / Bar Fight

Astalir sat at a bar, antlers fully out. He watched as a black cat in a wolf skin cloak walked up to the bar and sat next to him. He scanned her up and down. She was a black cat with a silver shimmer on her forehead and white socks on her feet. Her chest had a red scorch mark that stretched to the underside of her right armpit, which was heavily obscured by the wolf skin cape draped around her shoulders. Around her neck was a necklace sporting a preserved deer hoof. A quiver of arrows was strapped to her right leg, and a foldable bow was strapped to her left.

“Here to hunt the monster, too, I take it.” Astalir greeted.

“Tequila with lemon.” She told the bartender, before turning to Astalir. “Well, something of the sort. Who are you?”

“Astalir, bounty hunter. Nice to meet you.” He held out his hand to shake.

The cat looked at it funny, but awkwardly shook it anyways. “Nice to meet you… too.”

“And you?”

“Huh?”

“Who are you?”

“Oh, I’m Treescorn, regular hunter.”

“Nice to meet you.”

“Yes, nice to meet you.”

Astalir cleared his throat. “So, what do you know about the monster?”

“Which one?”

“The wolf at large in this village.”

Treescorn’s eyes floated to the sky. “He’s got big, squishy muscles, beautiful blue eyes, succulent lips, and a big, bulging—”

“Ahem, um…” Astalir coughed. “I mean, Anything we could use to fight him?”

“We?” Treescorn laughed as she took a sip of her tequila. “Don’t get me wrong, you’re hot for a buck, but you don’t look like the fighting type.”

“Thanks for the compliment. Now what do you know?”

“Buck, I don’t know you. I’m not about to share trade secrets with a stranger.”

“Ok.” Astalir turned to his drink: a cup of water.

“You too poor to buy alcohol?”

“Alcohol decreases my mental capacity. Water increases it.” He took a sip.

“Wow, I bet you’re real fun at parties.”

“I don’t go to parties.”

“I wonder why.”

“They’re a waste of time. The only thing—”

“I didn’t actually want to know.”

“…the only thing people do at parties is get drunk, puke, and destroy personal property. There’s a lot better uses for one’s time than—”

“Ok, I get it. You don’t like parties.”

“There’s a lot better use of—”

“Is this buck bothering you?” A cat stood up to the bar from a sitdown table.

“No, no, he’s fine.” Treescorn waved him off.

“Hey buck! Stop bothering the poor feline!” Another cat got up.

“I’m not bothering anybody.” Astalir protested.

“Listen, guys—ooh! Look at those muscles!” Treescorn eyed one of them. “I cant handle myself. Just go back to your tables and—”

“Buck! You better step away from her before I—”

“Let me drink my water in peace.” Astalir took another sip, emptying his glass. He slid it to the bartender. “More.”

The bartender obliged.

“Hey buck! Don’t turn your back on me!” The male cat grabbed Astalir’s shoulder and directed him towards him.

“You’re not a threat to me. Go back to your seat.”

The cat laughed. “Ha! You hear that boys! This dumb buck thinks he can take me on!” He dug his claws into Astalir’s shoulder, drawing blood. “You wanna take this outside?”

“That hurts.” Astalir looked at the cat. “Please remove your claws at once.”

The cat did so, but in the most painful way possible: by dragging them along Astalir’s shoulder.

“Wow, that hurt.” Astalir said dryly. “Ok, you’ve inflicted your pain. Go sit down now.”

The cat swiped at Astalir’s face, but Astalir blocked it with his antlers.

“Hey, you’ll dull my claws!”

“They’ll grow back.” Astalir stood up from his bar stool, towering at least a foot over the cat. “Sit down.”

The cat hissed.

“Ok, take it outside! Take it outside!” The bartender yelled.

“Ok.” Astalir grabbed his glass of water and took it out to the front of the bar, standing beneath the moonlight.

“What is with this guy?” Treescorn mused, drinking her booze.

“Alright, let’s do this!” The rowdy cat approached Astalir, with his buddies behind him. “Watch and learn, boys! This is how you take down an opponent bigger than you!”

The cat leapt at Astalir, going for the neck. Astalir’s middle hoof grew as the cat turned from an anthro cat standing on two legs, to a small house cat on four legs, who landed on the ground on all fours. The tiny cat clawed its way up Astalir’s legs, but then it got stuck in Astalir’s chest fur.

Astalir’s chest fur ensnared the cat and dropped it on the ground, where a red square appeared. The cat tried to walk outside the square, but found that it couldn’t. Everytime it tried to, it was like a switch went off, and the cat decided to stay in instead.

“Hey, don’t mess with our buddy like that!”

The four cats surrounded Astalir and enclosed on him. The ground beneath one of them reached up and grabbed its feet, pinning it to the ground. Another cat’s legs dug into the ground and grew bark, then its hands reached to the night sky, sprouting leaves. The third cat curled up into a ball, and became perfectly round. Astalir stepped aside to let it roll past him. The fourth cat’s head twisted backward, and it walked around in a dazed panic.

“Here, free yourself.” Astalir clipped off a piece of his middle finger hoof and tossed it on the tree cat’s branches.

Treescorn stepped outside. “Wow, I was going to mate with these guys tonight, but they’re a bunch of assholes. Want to mate with me instead?” She walked up to Astalir and ran a claw lightly under his chin.

“No.”

“Wow, I guess it’s all assholes tonight.”

“No, no assholes tonight. I turned them into a regular cat, a tree—”

Treescorn put a clawed finger to his mouth. “I don’t want to hear it. So how about that ‘monster’? Can you help me find him?”

“Yes.”

# Heart to Heart

“I know I’m weird. I’ve always known that.” Astalir sat down. “I don’t experience joy, or sadness, anger, or other emotions. I don’t know why I am that way, but I am.”

Treescorn hung her head. “I get that.”

“But I intend to find out.”

“Huh?”

“These monsters have clues about why we are the way we are. And if I find out why we are, I can find out why I am, and then I can repair myself.”

“Repair yourself? You’re talking about yourself like you’re a machine.”

“We’re all machines. Very, very complex machines.”

“No, we’re more than that.”

# Waterfall Shower

Inspired by this song: <https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=aDeNQNtW1f8>

Treescorn took off her wolf skin cape and her necklace, and folded them neatly on a rock. She dipped a toe into the edge of the pool and then stepped lightly into it. It hugged her black silky fur up past her knees. She sauntered to the small waterfall and lifted her head into it. She rubbed her hands all over her fur, helping the water lift the dirt out and clean her thoroughly.

While she was lathering, she noticed a certain buck standing on the side of the pool next to a tree, hiding in the shade. “Like what you see, Astalir?”

“Your fur is very shiny.” Astalir stated.

“Thank you.” Drathalion turned around. “What about from this angle?” She turned her butt to him, but twisted her neck around so she could still see him. She watched his cock as she lifted her tail.

“Yes, that fur is very shiny too.” Astalir’s member didn’t respond.

“Hmm.” Treescorn thought. “Is it still shiny if I do this?” She did a dance, waving her hips to and fro, and sliding her hands up and down her frame, sifting through her fur.

“Yes, still shiny.”

Treescorn stopped and looked at him. His dick hadn’t moved a bit. “What’s it going to take to get you horny?”

“They’re called antlers. Horns are what—”

“I know, I know. How about this?” She waved him forward.

He copied her motion.

“No, you big lug!” She laughed. “Come here!”

Astalir stepped into the water, shivering slightly as he waded to Treescorn.

Treescorn took his hoof hands in her paw hands and stared into his eyes. “Astalir, you like me, don’t you?”

“You’re a very good partner to work with, yes.”

“No, I mean, *like* me. Like, romantically.”

Astalir stared at her. His expression didn’t change.

“Do you know what love feels like?”

“Love, that’s the one where you blush and get all goofy, correct?”

Treescorn laughed. “Yes, that’s the one.”

“No, I don’t know what that feels like.”

“Would you like too?”

“I’m open to new experiences.”

“Ok, follow my lead.” Treescorn pursed her lips and moved them closer to his.

He did the same, moving his lips closer to the center.

She giggled and put her lips all the way to his. She made a smooching sound then pulled away. “How was that?”

“Your lips touched mine.”

“Yep!”

“So this is love?”

“Well, it’s more than that. *Much* more than that.”

Astalir licked his lips. “You left some of your saliva on my lips.”

“How does it taste?”

“Like sugar water.”

“Wanna go again?”

Astalir pursed his lips, smacking them onto Treescorn’s. “Ow.”

“Take it easy, nice and slow.” She met his lips with hers. This time, she wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him in closer. She lifted her lips a little, enough to let her tongue slide into Astalir’s mouth.

He pulled back, breaking free of her grasp. “Your tongue invaded my mouth.”

“I’m sorry, do you not like that?”

His eyes darted back and forth. “Now I can say I experienced love.”

“Wait, that’s not the whole experience—”

“I got an idea.” He waded out of the water. “I’ll set up camp while you bathe.”

Treescorn held out her hand, hoping he’d come back. But he didn’t, and her arm hung at her side. She shrugged, and with a slight smile, she licked a bit of his saliva off her lip.

# Lovely Weather for a Walk

Astalir and Treescorn walked through the woods, following the trail of the monster. Treescorn’s wolf skin cape flowed in the wind, and her deer hoof necklace swayed with each step.

“You have a deer hoof around your neck.” Astalir stated.

“Pretty, isn’t it?”

“It’s an official hoof clipping from the Adirada tribe’s matriarch.”

“You’re very observant.”

“It’s rare to get such a clipping.”

“Is it? I thought everyone had one.”

“It’s something you’d only get if you had a change you wanted to become permanent.”

“Astalir?”

“Yes?”

“When’s the last time you minded your own business?”

“Right now: I’m tracking down—”

“I know, Astalir, I know.”

“Well, I suspect that—”

“What’s your point, Astalir?”

Silence. Astalir led her through the woods on the monster’s trail. “I was just trying to start a conversation.”

“Well choose something less personal next time.”

His ears flicked up and down. “The weather is calm today.”

“It sure is, Astalir. Lovely weather for a walk.”

# Post-Battle

“Astalir, you saved me.” Treescorn stood with her hands on her knees, panting.

“I did.”

“Why? You could’ve been seriously injured or killed.”

“I… don’t know.”

Treescorn smiled. “You care about me, don’t you?”

Astalir looked away. “You’re a vital part of this operation.”

“Ahhhh!” Treescorn rubbed her head up against his neck. “Admit it!”

“I couldn’t do this mission without you.”

She pecked him on the cheek. “I love you, too.”

Astalir turned his arm over. It had a big gash, with blood dripping down.

“Oh, you’re injured!”

“I am bleeding. It is very painful.”

“Here, stand still.” Treescorn lifted a hand to the gash in his arm. Her palm revealed a burn scar that glowed a bright yellow. She placed it on his arm, and the gash sealed up. The skin and fur fused back together, and into each other. “There, all better.” She kissed it.

Astalir felt along the gash line. It was a messy blend of skin and fur, but it was closed. “It still hurts, but it won’t get infected this way.”

“Yes, my love.” She kissed his forehead.

“So, this is love?”

“In a way, yes.” She smiled at him. “Do you feel it?”

He ran his finger along his scar. “Yes. It feels bumpy.”

Treescorn giggled.

# Wolf Pack

Astalir and Treescorn rescued four wolf pups from an incident involving a monster. After they got them back to their mother, Treescorn ran off into the woods. “I’ll be… I’ll be right back.”

“Ok.” Astalir stood by, waiting for her.

After a little bit, he heard a strange noise. It sounded like laughter, but wrong. “Treescorn?”

“I’ll be… I’ll be... right \*sniff\* out.”

He followed her scent to her location. She was sitting on a log with her face in her hands, tears streaming down her face. “Treescorn, your eyes are leaking. Are you injured?”

Treescorn giggled through her sobs. “I’m… I’m ok.”

Astalir’s eyes searched the sky as his left ear flapped up and down. “S… sadness? Is this sadness?”

Treescorn looked into his eyes and nodded. She broke down into tears.

“I’ll seal your eyelids closed. That’ll stop the leaking.” He readied his middle finger hoof.

“No no no, I’m fine. Don’t do that.”

“I want to help.”

Treescorn sobbed through the tears. “Astalir, have you ever felt sadness?”

Astalir breathed in. “Is it similar to pain?”

“Yeah… it’s… emotional pain.”

“I understand.”

Treescorn patted the log beside her, motioning to Astalir to sit down.

He sat with his hands on his knees, head turned to her.

“You ever see something that brings up bad memories?”

“Everytime I see peas and carrots right next to each other—”

“So, you want to know about this hoof, huh?”

“I am curious about it, yes.”

“Well, you’re in luck. I need to vent.” Treescorn took a deep breath. “Those four wolf pups we rescued today. They reminded me of my childhood. You see, when I was a little boy, my brothers and I would rough house just like they did. We fought amongst ourselves all the time: over food, over toys, over girls.”

Astalir’s eyes lit up. He nodded.

“Then one day I lost them all. They disowned me, kicked me out.”

“You had more than partner.” Astalir nodded.

“You know wolves, huh? Them and their loyalty.” She took a deep breath. “I miss my brothers. I wonder how they’re doing, and if they’re faring well. I wonder if… if…”

“If what?”

“No…”

“If what?”

“…if,” she sobbed. “If they miss me, too.”

“They haven’t seen you in years, thus they also are missing you.”

“Heh heh. That’s sweet, but… no, missing is a… feeling. It’s more than just not seeing someone for a long time.”

“I see.” Astalir stared at the ground. “So love, but sadness?”

“Love but sadness.” Treescorn nodded.

# Treescorn’s Vow

Treescorn hung her arms around Astalir’s neck, gazing dreamily into his eyes. “All this time running around, I never thought I’d never have a partner. I thought my life would be a series of one-night stands and orgies. But you, Astalir, made me realize that love isn’t just sex.”

“But that’s what love is.” Astalir protested.

Treescorn giggled. “No, Astalir. You made me realize that it wasn’t love, just lust. Which is good in its own way, you should really try it sometime. But you taught me that love is what you do for each other, when you find someone you care about, and want to see the best for.” She took his hands together in hers. “Astalir, I can’t promise you I won’t have sex with anyone but you, but I can promise you, as a former wolf of loyalty, that I’ll always be loyal to you.”

“Thank you.”

She shook their hands as she giggled. “Now you go.”

“Treescorn, Drathalion, I feel pleasure when I look at you, and when you smile. You are a valuable part of my team, and I have a vested interest in your survival. I will do my best to keep you safe, and h… happy?”

“Happy.”

“Safe and happy.”

“Promise?”

“I promise.”

“Kiss me.” Treescorn leaned in for a kiss, met soon by Astalir.

They took a good long moment to absorb the sealing kiss. The waterfall provided the ambience and the pool they both stood in. Butterflies fluttered all around, accompanied by dandelion seedlings. The sun’s rays made the water sparkle.

“How does it feel to be partnered with a cat?” Treescorn smiled.

“This is the beginning of a long period of time.” Astalir turned the edges of his lips up, mimicking her smile.

“It’s ok, you don’t have to smile.” She licked his muzzle, letting his muscles relax. “I know you’re smiling inside, even if you can’t show it or feel it.”

Astalir breathed out through his nose, and pulled her in for a kiss.

“Whew! I could get used to this!” She embraced him, and they kissed under the waterfall.

# Tree Swing

Astalir’s middle finger hoof grew as the environment around him shifted. The bark on a log lying on the ground depressed into itself, leaving a hole on either side of the log that went all the way through. Tree branches above him thickened and grew straight out horizontally. Grass traveled to the log, combined together, and shot up through the holes in the logs to grab onto the horizontal tree branches. The grass wrapped around the log and lifted it into the air, about to Astalir’s knee height.

Astalir sat on the log, and pushed off with his legs. It swung back and forth. “Drathalion! The surprise is ready!”

The black, shiny-furred cat stumbled out from behind a tree, her wolf skin cape draped over her face. “Can I look now?”

“No, you have to arrive first.”

“seStalara!”

“Ok, ok. You may open your eyes.”

“Finally.” Drathalion reached for her cape.

“But you can’t take the cape off.”

“seStalara…”

“Ok, fine, you can look.”

Drathalion let her cape hang out from her shoulders. She opened her eyes to behold the swing that seStalara just constructed.

“You made this?” Her jaw dropped. “This is amazing!”

“It is only a fraction of my power.”

They sat down on the swing. Drathalion leaned up against seStalara’s shoulder and flung his arm around her shoulder.

“This is nice.” She rubbed her cat face in his deer chest floof.

“Yes.”

“seStalara?”

“Yes?”

“You said you were looking for the origin of our kind, right?”

“Yes.”

“So you could find out why you are the way you are, right?”

“Yes.” He placed a hand on her head.

“Well, whether or not you find out, I want you to know…” She rubbed her cheek against his finger. “I love you the way you are.”

seStalara froze. He stared straight ahead, his ears hung in between up and down, and his hand stopped rubbing Drathalion’s head.

“seStalara?”

seStalara looked down at her, but otherwise didn’t move.

“Are you ok?”

He unfroze, resumed petting her, and peacefully closed his eyes. “Thanks, Drathalion. I needed to hear that.”

“I love you.”

“I love you, too.”
