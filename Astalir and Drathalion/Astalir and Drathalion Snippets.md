# Astalir and Drathalion Snippets

Here are some snippets of a story I want to tell about Astalir and Drathalion, both characters originating from DnD campaigns I played in, but who am I porting over to Ersatzica’s world.

# Stick in the Mud

Treescorn tells a joke, and laughs.

Astalir continues on, face straight.

“Do you ever laugh?” Treescorn asks.

“No.”

“You’re a real stick-in-the-mud, aren’t you?”

“They’re called antlers, and I never sharpen them in mud.”

Treescorn stops walking. “Wow.”

# Treescorn’s Hoof Necklace / Bar Fight

Astalir sat at a bar, antlers fully out. He watched as a black cat in a wolf skin cloak walked up to the bar and sat next to him. He scanned her up and down. She was a black cat with a silver shimmer on her forehead and white socks on her feet. Her chest had a red scorch mark that stretched to the underside of her right armpit, which was heavily obscured by the wolf skin cape draped around her shoulders. Around her neck was a necklace sporting a preserved deer hoof. A quiver of arrows was strapped to her right leg, and a foldable bow was strapped to her left.

“Here to hunt the monster, too, I take it.” Astalir greeted.

“Tequila with lemon.” She told the bartender, before turning to Astalir. “Well, something of the sort. Who are you?”

“Astalir, bounty hunter. Nice to meet you.” He held out his hand to shake.

The cat looked at it funny, but awkwardly shook it anyways. “Nice to meet you… too.”

“And you?”

“Huh?”

“Who are you?”

“Oh, I’m Treescorn, regular hunter.”

“Nice to meet you.”

“Yes, nice to meet you.”

Astalir cleared his throat. “So, what do you know about the monster?”

“Which one?”

“The wolf at large in this village.”

Treescorn’s eyes floated to the sky. “He’s got big, squishy muscles, beautiful blue eyes, succulent lips, and a big, bulging—”

“Ahem, um…” Astalir coughed. “I mean, Anything we could use to fight him?”

“We?” Treescorn laughed as she took a sip of her tequila. “Don’t get me wrong, you’re hot for a buck, but you don’t look like the fighting type.”

“Thanks for the compliment. Now what do you know?”

“Buck, I don’t know you. I’m not about to share trade secrets with a stranger.”

“Ok.” Astalir turned to his drink: a cup of water.

“You too poor to buy alcohol?”

“Alcohol decreases my mental capacity. Water increases it.” He took a sip.

“Wow, I bet you’re real fun at parties.”

“I don’t go to parties.”

“I wonder why.”

“They’re a waste of time. The only thing—”

“I didn’t actually want to know.”

“…the only thing people do at parties is get drunk, puke, and destroy personal property. There’s a lot better uses for one’s time than—”

“Ok, I get it. You don’t like parties.”

“There’s a lot better use of—”

“Is this buck bothering you?” A cat stood up to the bar from a sitdown table.

“No, no, he’s fine.” Treescorn waved him off.

“Hey buck! Stop bothering the poor feline!” Another cat got up.

“I’m not bothering anybody.” Astalir protested.

“Listen, guys—ooh! Look at those muscles!” Treescorn eyed one of them. “I cant handle myself. Just go back to your tables and—”

“Buck! You better step away from her before I—”

“Let me drink my water in peace.” Astalir took another sip, emptying his glass. He slid it to the bartender. “More.”

The bartender obliged.

“Hey buck! Don’t turn your back on me!” The male cat grabbed Astalir’s shoulder and directed him towards him.

“You’re not a threat to me. Go back to your seat.”

The cat laughed. “Ha! You hear that boys! This dumb buck thinks he can take me on!” He dug his claws into Astalir’s shoulder, drawing blood. “You wanna take this outside?”

“That hurts.” Astalir looked at the cat. “Please remove your claws at once.”

The cat did so, but in the most painful way possible: by dragging them along Astalir’s shoulder.

“Wow, that hurt.” Astalir said dryly. “Ok, you’ve inflicted your pain. Go sit down now.”

The cat swiped at Astalir’s face, but Astalir blocked it with his antlers.

“Hey, you’ll dull my claws!”

“They’ll grow back.” Astalir stood up from his bar stool, towering at least a foot over the cat. “Sit down.”

The cat hissed.

“Ok, take it outside! Take it outside!” The bartender yelled.

“Ok.” Astalir grabbed his glass of water and took it out to the front of the bar, standing beneath the moonlight.

“What is with this guy?” Treescorn mused, drinking her booze.

“Alright, let’s do this!” The rowdy cat approached Astalir, with his buddies behind him. “Watch and learn, boys! This is how you take down an opponent bigger than you!”

The cat leapt at Astalir, going for the neck. Astalir’s middle hoof grew as the cat turned from an anthro cat standing on two legs, to a small house cat on four legs, who landed on the ground on all fours. The tiny cat clawed its way up Astalir’s legs, but then it got stuck in Astalir’s chest fur.

Astalir’s chest fur ensnared the cat and dropped it on the ground, where a red square appeared. The cat tried to walk outside the square, but found that it couldn’t. Everytime it tried to, it was like a switch went off, and the cat decided to stay in instead.

“Hey, don’t mess with our buddy like that!”

The four cats surrounded Astalir and enclosed on him. The ground beneath one of them reached up and grabbed its feet, pinning it to the ground. Another cat’s legs dug into the ground and grew bark, then its hands reached to the night sky, sprouting leaves. The third cat curled up into a ball, and became perfectly round. Astalir stepped aside to let it roll past him. The fourth cat’s head twisted backward, and it walked around in a dazed panic.

“Here, free yourself.” Astalir clipped off a piece of his middle finger hoof and tossed it on the tree cat’s branches.

Treescorn stepped outside. “Wow, I was going to mate with these guys tonight, but they’re a bunch of assholes. Want to mate with me instead?” She walked up to Astalir and ran a claw lightly under his chin.

“No.”

“Wow, I guess it’s all assholes tonight.”

“No, no assholes tonight. I turned them into a regular cat, a tree—”

Treescorn put a clawed finger to his mouth. “I don’t want to hear it. So how about that ‘monster’? Can you help me find him?”

“Yes.”

# Heart to Heart

“I know I’m weird. I’ve always known that.” Astalir sat down. “I don’t experience joy, or sadness, anger, or other emotions. I don’t know why I am that way, but I am.”

Treescorn hung her head. “I get that.”

“But I intend to find out.”

“Huh?”

“These monsters have clues about why we are the way we are. And if I find out why we are, I can find out why I am, and then I can repair myself.”

“Repair yourself? You’re talking about yourself like you’re a machine.”

“We’re all machines. Very, very complex machines.”

“No, we’re more than that.”
